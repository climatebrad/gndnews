Anybody who can throw coal into a furnace can learn how to program, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\nWhat, exactly, these blue collar workers in the mining and coal-shoveling sectors should learn to code is unclear. A December jobs report by Challenger, Gray, & Christmas found that the mining and tech sectors\u00a0are both shedding thousands of jobs nationwide. (So too is everything coal-related.) It\u2019s fair to say the long-term prospects for IT workers are better, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting that computer and information technology jobs will grow \u201c12 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations.\u201d Meanwhile, dirty energy jobs are dying left and right despite Donald Trump\u2019s best efforts to slash regulations.\nBut the issue has less to do with whether programming is a desirable skillset\u2014it is, in the same sense that speaking Arabic or having a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering are desirable skillsets. To Biden\u2019s point, there are plenty of success stories, including with laid-off miners. This instead has more to do with whether everyone has the desire or aptitude to learn programming to plunge into an ultra-competitive job market for developers, whether job retraining programs are actually effective or will be adequately funded, or whether advising someone to just get a much more lucrative job in a high-tech sector actually comes across as helpful.\nAs Weigel noted, being told what you really need to do is pivot to making smartphone apps or coding a payroll system can instead come across as callous indifference to the what is currently happening to workers right now.  (Especially so, given the future is not synonymous with STEM jobs and the gaping disconnect between how the tech sector generates wealth and how it doesn\u2019t really share it.) That\u2019s exactly why \u201clearn to code\u201d became the far right\u2019s taunt of choice when mocking laid-off journalists. Maybe, uhh, nip this particular line in the bud and instead focus on the infrastructure, clean energy, and labor organizing stuff.\nIn any case, as far as lukewarm technocratic ideas go, Biden is at least winning out over fellow Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg, who tweeted on Monday that if elected he would put the disastrous open office model\u00a0in effect at the White House.", "body_links": ["https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1211763169926012930", "https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/30/technology/computer-science-obama-program/index.html", "http://www.challengergray.com/press/press-releases/2019-november-challenger-report-penultimate-month-job-cuts-fall-11-ytd-13", "https://www.barrons.com/articles/retail-hiring-tech-sector-firing-and-the-outlook-for-gold-51575680451", "https://247wallst.com/jobs/2019/12/05/2019-job-losses-at-4-year-high-as-tech-mining-fire-more-workers/", "https://www.swtimes.com/news/20191103/coal-jobs-are-about-to-take-another-hit", "http://bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/business/coal-power-dying/index.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/opinion/sunday/silicon-valley-tech.html", "https://www.wired.com/2015/11/can-you-teach-a-coal-miner-to-code/", "https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/", "http://theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/the-false-promises-of-worker-retraining/549398/", "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-apologizes-coal-country-over-out-business-comments-n566451", "https://newrepublic.com/article/153019/fetid-right-wing-origins-learn-code", "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611297/obama-economist-were-not-preparing-workers-for-changing-jobs/", "http://bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-clinton-trump-silicon-valley/", "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/04/technology-doesnt-cause-inequality-enables-it-to-thrive", "https://thinkprogress.org/learn-to-code-decoded-the-campaign-against-laid-off-journalists-is-harassments-new-frontier-20725ddd480a/", "https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/biden-releases-13-trillion-infrastructure-plan-070848", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/06/04/joe-biden-embraces-green-new-deal-he-releases-climate-plan/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-25/joe-biden-unveils-labor-plan-in-appeal-to-middle-class-voters", "https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/01/jobs-workplace-privacy-open-offices-cubicles.html"]},

Hopeful things.\nBut honestly, I can\u2019t get excited about hope when it comes to the climate crisis. It\u2019s a monstrous mess. Multinational corporations worth billions of dollars have caused it while lying about their role in doing so. And people in the halls of power have aided and abetted them. The world\u2019s emissions have continued to rise to the point that we now need to cut them a staggering 78 percent over the next decade to limit the damage to bad as opposed to catastrophic.\n\u201cAbandon all hope, ye who enter here,\u201d is emblazoned on the gates of Hell in Dante\u2019s Inferno, but it may as well have been written about climate change.\nI get that hope is a thing we\u2019re all looking for amidst the worsening climate carnage, but I firmly believe hope isn\u2019t the most useful thing to steer us away from a worst-case scenario. And I\u2019m not alone. In a\u2014and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to write these words\u2014viral Twitter thread, climate essayist, activist, and Hot Take podcast host Mary Heglar laid out the case against hope better than I could, noting it\u2019s \u201cstale AF and ending shit on a high note has fueled a lot of inertia.\u201d\nThe Green New Deal is visionary approach to climate politics and American life. If passed, it would \nHer solution was to stop asking what gives climate activists hope and start asking \u201chow can I help?\u201d Which at the end of the day is the exact question we should be asking. The climate crisis will be only be solved through sustained, collective action over the coming decade. We\u2019ve seen what the start of a public pressure campaign can look like globally with the climate strike movement, but it\u2019s a start, not the end. And it\u2019s hardly the only way into the fight for a future we can be proud of.\nEarther reached out to a handful of activists to ask \u201chow can I help?\u201d Their answers are below, lightly edited for brevity.\n Fuck hope. Long live action.\n\u201cI think that some of the tasks for the year are, for obvious reasons, political, and that others involve taking on the financial industry that bankrolls gas, oil and coal. I seem to be concentrating on the latter tasks for the moment.\u201d\n\u201cBreak the silence: Start talking about the climate emergency and the need for WWII scale climate mobilization \u2014 in a realistic, blunt, emergency-focused way, in your family, social circles, and beyond.\n\u201cJoin the Climate Emergency Movement. There are a lot of organizations that have burst forth this year that are championing a climate emergency message and solution\u2014 Sunrise, Extinction Rebellion, Youth Climate Strikes, The Climate Mobilization, and more. Join us, support us, help us build power!\u201d\n\u201cOne of the literary treasures of our time, Rebecca Solnit, offered us in her book, Hope in the Dark, \u2018Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency.\u2019 I would never presume to speak for Sister Solnit, but what I get from this quote is that Hope without action is like expecting a rock to float on water because you meditate. \n\u201cSister Heglar was absolutely correct to take umbrage with questions like, \u2018what gives you hope?\u2019 If that question is not followed by, \u2018how does your hope catalyze your drive to act,\u2019 it\u2019s not at all helpful and perambulates what is really called for at this moment, it fosters torpidity through an illusion of action. The people of Haiti have hope, the people of Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador have hope, the people in Hong Kong and France have hope, but they seem to realize that hope alone does not bring about transformational and structural change. Being hopeful can be risky, being hopeful without action is even riskier, and the biggest risk is the one not taken.\u201d \n\u201cI think people are going to want to hear there is a quick, simple thing they can do: recycle, go to a march, talk about the science, etc. Those are good things, but it would be dishonest of me to say that\u2019s enough. In order to \u2018help\u2019 we must address the actual problem, which is a growth-dependent, fossil-fueled economic system that has stratified power in favor of an elite few who put profit above people and the planet. The way ordinary people can and have overcome the injustice of our economic system and the 1% is through the Labor Movement and our power as workers to strike and halt the economy in its tracks. So, my unconventional answer is that you can help by organizing your workplace to address the Climate Emergency through \u2018green\u2019 collective bargaining agreements, advocating for a Green New Deal, endorsing \u2018climate\u2019 candidates, and building community alliances through strikes for the planetary good. \n\u201cThe fight for our future must be an all-hands-on-deck effort, and another way you can help is by utilizing your social networks to bring more people into the climate movement. Organize your sports team, church, university, professional association, etc. to leverage its power to fight for climate action and a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\u201cWhen people ask me about the \u2018best\u2019 action they might take to address climate change, I talk about the things we all need to do together and the things we can each uniquely do. Together, there\u2019s voting and otherwise supporting strong climate candidates at all levels and supporting, with your dollars or your two feet or both, the grassroots organizing movements that push politicians to do better.  This opens up systems change opportunities, and ensures you have compatriots when the going gets tough.\n\u201cBut don\u2019t forget to also look for the things that you uniquely can do, the conversation only you can have with your uncle because he trusts you, the art that only you can make that might inspire someone else to act, the community conversation you can convene so beautifully because you know so many different types of folks. Also, you uniquely can leverage your expertise in healthcare, or museums, or teaching, or farming towards climate protection. Because climate touches everything, you don\u2019t need to drop everything to work on climate, you just need to figure out what it means to do what you do in way that also reduces emissions or builds resiliency.\u201d", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/spains-biggest-polluter-is-sponsoring-the-latest-un-cli-1840153678", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-worst-environmental-rollbacks-of-2019-1840518827", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/most-states-have-cut-environmental-agencies-budgets-at-1840246534", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-amazon-is-fucked-under-brazils-president-new-data-1839924025", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-report-shows-the-world-needs-to-cut-emissions-78-per-1840046835", "https://twitter.com/MaryHeglar/status/1210199765536985089", "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hot-take/id1488414960", "https://twitter.com/MaryHeglar/status/1210202566312841217", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/greta-thunberg-didnt-win-the-nobel-peace-prize-good-1838970358", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-indigenous-youth-were-2019s-climate-warriors-1840682480", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-i-decided-to-skip-buying-wrapping-paper-this-year-1840564071", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/for-30-days-im-going-to-eat-like-im-trying-to-save-the-1832239885", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/australian-prime-minister-will-return-from-vacation-to-1840535037"]},

At least 43 people have died and nearly 400,000 have been left displaced. \nMore rains are expected in the coming week, further adding to the country\u2019s watery woes. As a last-ditch effort to stave off more flooding, the Indonesian government resorted to a controversial measure of to control the weather by seeding clouds with salt.\nReuters reports that the Indonesian technology agency BPPT conducted three rounds of seeding Friday, and officials are expecting to continue the program as long as necessary. The idea behind cloud seeding is pretty straightforward. Salt, soot, or other tiny particles known as aerosols form the nucleus of water droplets\u2014the precursor to raindrops\u2014inside clouds. Injecting them is typically used to create rain, not stop it. In the past, governments in South Korea and Thailand have explored cloud seeding as an option to make it rain in an effort to combat severe air pollution.\nAir pollution is taking over cities around the world. As the State of the Air report released\u2026\nIndonesia is trying something different by  overloading clouds with particles. This method should create a sort of surplus of nuclei where water can form into droplets, forcing them to compete for water. Since there wouldn\u2019t be enough water in the cloud for each droplet to hold and combine to become raindrops, it should in theory stop rainfall. Daniel Rosenfeld, an award-winning researcher on the topic and professor of earth sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Earther that this type of cloud seeding has happened in the skies over Russia and China. \nHowever, these locations don\u2019t have tropical clouds. And tropical clouds\u2014like the ones in Indonesia\u2014carry a lot more water, Rosenfeld said. The cloud seeding may delay the rain from falling, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. In fact, Rosenfeld worries that this would cause the clouds to release more rain than they otherwise would have. \n\u201cI am very doubtful that it would work where there is so much water such as a deep tropical cloud. It seems to be pretty desperate,\u201d he told Earther. \u201cThey are trying to hang on to any straw to save a situation. Even if the chance to succeed is very small.\u201d \nGeorge Bomar, a cloud seeding expert with the state of Texas\u2019 weather modification program, told Earther that this area still needs more research to know whether it can truly stop rain from falling. He told Earther in an email that there\u2019s some evidence that \u201cvigorous seeding in the early stage of a thunderstorm\u2019s life\u201d can make water fall as ice, instead, but even that is still a concept. \n\u201cHaving said that, I do not rule out the potential for seeding to suppress rainfall,\u201d he wrote. \nThe situation in Indonesia is a grave one. On New Year\u2019s Eve, more than 14 inches of rain fell, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Authorities don\u2019t expect the rain to let up until next week. This is Indonesia\u2019s monsoon season (which lasts until March) so heavy rainfall isn\u2019t unheard of. But this rainfall has been particularly unforgiving. Roads are closed, and the power is out. Even flights have been canceled as the airport faces flooding, too. More intense rainfall is one of the hallmarks of climate change due to the simple fact that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. That makes extreme events like the one that pounded Indonesia more likely. \nHeavy rain is hardly the only climate threat Jakarta faces.\u00a0Jakarta is sinking at the same time as seas rise. That\u2019s why the government is moving the capital to East Kalimantan. That\u2019s not a bad idea, especially as climate change threatens Jakarta\u2019s residents with further flooding as sea levels rise and storms become more powerful. This week\u2019s heavy rainfall\u2014and the fact that the government has turned to cloud seeding as a last resort\u2014only adds to the need to get out of harms way.", "body_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indonesia-capital-floods-leave-43-dead-397000-displaced/2020/01/03/6ef2a33a-2ded-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-weather-floods/indonesia-seeds-clouds-to-keep-them-away-from-flooded-capital-idUSKBN1Z203J?feedType=RSS&feedName=environmentNews", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/south-korea-wants-to-use-artificial-rain-to-wash-away-i-1833136917", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/smog-choked-bangkok-is-going-to-make-it-rain-1831740321?_ga=2.248620622.898074108.1556119602-176209186.1553264814", "https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/flash-update-no-01-flooding-jakarta-metropolitan-area-indonesia-02-january-2020", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/indonesia-is-moving-its-capital-city-as-the-current-one-1834420363"]},

How do I deal with such feelings? Why, plans and preparation, of course.\nI tease my boyfriend\u2014who works in carpentry and construction\u2014that he\u2019ll have to outfit our future home with an underground bunker. That might sound ridiculous, but I\u2019m actually quite serious. When the water wars happen, I\u2019ll be safe tucked away (ditto for the zombie apocalypse). Alas, an entire house with enough yard space for a bunker is fairly unrealistic for the foreseeable future living in New York City. But with the climate crisis worsening, I figure I need to do something and soon. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve opted to prepare a climate emergency kit in the new year.\nI know. Most people resolve to visit the gym or read more in the new year. That\u2019s just not how I roll. I need to be better prepared for a climate disaster. \nThe Trump administration issued blow after blow to environmental protections this year. Sometimes,\u2026\nI often dream about saving my Long Island-based family from zombies. I\u2019m stuck trying to figure out how to reach them from Queens all the while fending off hoards of zombies alone with a machete. It\u2019s terrifying, and I\u2019m pretty sure these dreams are a metaphor for the climate apocalypse. In New York, that likely means some kind of dangerous hurricane, flooding, the polar vortex, or some extreme heatwave. I reached out to some experts about how to prepare my climate disaster kit. Here\u2019s the deal so you can get ready, too.\nDisaster looks different for all of us. There\u2019s rural vs. urban, inland vs. coastal, hot vs. cold. In cities, people face the potential of running out of supplies because of \u201cvulnerable supply chains,\u201d Eric Stern, a professor at the University of Albany\u2019s College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cyber-Security, wrote in an email to Earther. While rural areas might have more resilient food supplies and potentially indigenous knowledge from tribal nations in the area, they may lack immediate access to healthcare and medicine.\nThese are all realities families have to consider when preparing for what may hit them. Would a blackout mean you\u2019ll face the harsh cold, or would it mean you\u2019d lose access to air conditioning? Is a shelter nearby, or would you have to stay home? No matter where we are and what we face, though, a few items are necessary for your kit. What I learned in preparing to create my kit is that there are actually two types of kits: a go-bag and a long-term kit. \nIf you\u2019re in a hurry to evacuate, you grab your go-bag. If you\u2019re forced to stay in a place for a while, you turn to a longer-term stay kit, Jeff Schlegelmilch, the deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, said in an email to Earther.\n\u201cThe main difference between a go-bag and a stay kit is the amount of contents,\u201d Schlegelmilch said. \u201cA go bag is based on how much you can carry. Whereas to stay, the planning guidance is to have enough supplies for 72 hours to a week or more.\u201d\nI\u2019m planning to make one of each in 2020. We all should. I could very well be in a situation where my apartment floods and I gotta dip\u2014or one where flooding is limited to the streets outside, and I\u2019m stuck at home for days. Both kits should include a few essentials to last for at least three days:\nWater is important, but in your go bag, you have to be sure to bring only what you can physically carry with you. A few gallons can get heavy, so be mindful. As for food, that\u2019s really up to you, but canned vegetables and canned beans sound like a win for me. Perhaps even nuts and dried meats like jerky. These won\u2019t go bad right away, and you can pretty much eat them as is. Plus, I\u2019ve watched enough Walking Dead to know that, in the apocalypse, such simple treasures bring people lots of joy. \nAlong with the basic essentials, we all have our own special circumstances to consider, said Schlegelmilch. For me, that\u2019s my cat. My precious boy Mellow will need food and water, too, when shit goes down. I\u2019ll probably also grab a leash for him so I don\u2019t lose him if we\u2019re in a scramble and he tries to run off because, well, he\u2019s a cat. And to  keep him happy, I\u2019ll include some of the plastic twist ties he loves to play with (bonus: they don\u2019t take up much space). For parents with actual kids, special additions may include a stuffed animal or toy. And for people (or family members) with a chronic illness, don\u2019t forget specific medications. \nHaving all this stuff ready in your closet is one thing. But Schlegelmilch suggests being ready at all times, though. For instance, he always tries to carry basic first aid supplies, a spare charger, a phone battery, water, and a flashlight. That sounds tough for me as a carless New Yorker unless I carry a huge purse around all the time, but it should be easier for folks with vehicles since you can just keep this stuff in the trunk. \n\u201cThis is kind of a mini version of a go-bag to help get you out of a situation and to help in the event of an incident at work or on your commute,\u201d he wrote.\nIt\u2019s easy for many of us to assume we\u2019d never face disaster, but the truth is it can happen to anyone. The best way to avoid a true disaster\u2014one where you and your family and loved ones suffer harm\u2014is to be ready. The tragic reality, unfortunately, is that we can\u2019t all afford to prepare such elaborate kits. Schlegelmilch said he also knows some people who carry around n95 respirator masks, which can protect from harmful air pollutants. Hardcore but also a little pricy as an everyday item. \nI priced out the basics for a three day emergency kit, and it came out to more than $100 for myself alone with minimal luxuries (pinto beans for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, here I come). That doesn\u2019t include the duffle to hold all this stuff. The reality is that some people simply can\u2019t afford that when they have other bills to pay, Stern  said.\n\u201c[M]any people in our country do not have the economic means margins to set aside supplies for extended periods and/or purchase specialized equipment that would only be used in a very negative scenario,\u201d he wrote.\nThat\u2019s why my 2020 preparation has got to go further than simply a duffle bag full of resources. What\u2019s key in these situations is community. You see, there\u2019s no academic research that\u2019s proven how effective these emergency kits may be, but literature does exist showing the benefits of being connected to your community. Inanimate objects can go only so far;  people need to be able to rely on one another. \n\u201cThere is a lot of research out of many disasters\u2026 showing social connectedness, neighbors helping neighbors, being the strongest predictor of survival as well as health and mental health after a disaster,\u201d said Schlegelmilch. \u201cSo if you are not sure of what to put in your kit, talk to your neighbor, have a block party, get to know others who you may be surviving a disaster with.\u201d\nPerhaps it\u2019s time I knock on my neighbors\u2019 door. The college-aged women next door might be incredibly obnoxious with their Saturday night shenanigans, but we could be key to each other\u2019s survival if and when shit goes down. And with the way our world leaders are handling the severity of the climate crisis, I can\u2019t help but think that this scenario is inevitable.

How does an artist follow up a career-defining piece of work? For Shinkai, it all came back to remembering his audience.\nWith Weathering With You about to make its western debut this month, io9 recently had the chance to sit down with Shinkai in London to discuss bringing his next big project outside of Japan\u2014and how the global reach of his breakout work on Your Name (including an upcoming westernized adaptation), inspired him to return to familiar themes and ideas for his first film in the wake of such a massively successful movie. Check out our full interview with the director below.\n[Note: This interview as conducted through a translator, and has been edited for clarity.]\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this before: A boy yearning for a better life in the big city and a girl\u2026\nio9: How have you felt about the reaction to Weathering With You so far back home? What\u2019s it like coming to this international audience, having already got a gauge on it back in Japan?\nMakoto Shinkai: We know this is going to be the box office number one for 2019, and that it\u2019s number two after Your Name for the last few years, which is something I\u2019m very grateful for. It seems to have been particularly popular amongst young audiences. It didn\u2019t get as big an audience as Your Name and that\u2019s slightly disappointing and something I want to do better with next time. \nI think, in order to attract the same number of audiences as Your Name, I need to have people who don\u2019t usually go to the cinema coming to watch the film. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way to reach that number. Because I think people who like films will have seen [Weathering With You]\u2014it\u2019s the people who don\u2019t usually see the films that I really want to get next time. In regards to going overseas, I\u2019ve been really looking forward to coming to London because I\u2019ve lived here for a while. I\u2019ve got friends here. I get to see people. It\u2019s a bit like coming home, so it\u2019s always nice to come to London!io9: Speaking of your international reach with Your Name\u2014 it was so well-received we\u2019ve got the news of a western adaptation, with J.J. Abrams onboard.  What has your involvement been in the wake of that announcement, and how do you feel about the story being remade from a western perspective?  Shinkai: I\u2019m leaving it to him, to a large extent\u2014I\u2019m not micro-managing. And I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what they come up with. But they do send me all the script revisions and ask my opinion. So, I\u2019m involved in that way. I can\u2019t tell you how it\u2019s going, I\u2019m afraid. But, I think it\u2019s going to be a really interesting film. It\u2019s been very interesting for me to see how they\u2019ve taken this unique Japanese setting and transferred that to the U.S.\u2014so, it\u2019s going to be interesting.\nio9: When you started the creative process on Weathering in the wake of Your Name\u2019s reception,  did you keep in mind this big, international audience that\u2019s potentially going to know your name and follow your work? Was that something that influenced you as you were hashing out ideas for the movie?\nShinkai: As you say, thanks to Your Name, a lot of people, including these audiences, found out about me and got to know my work. And so, I did hope that a lot of people would come to see the film from other countries, as well. But at the same time, I was very aware that I don\u2019t think have the ability yet to make something on the par with Disney or Pixar, or Hollywood movies, that\u2019s really something everyone everywhere can enjoy. So, I think what I was aiming for was something Japanese audiences would really enjoy\u2014and if Japanese audiences enjoyed it, then maybe foreign audiences might enjoy it as well.\nio9: There\u2019s a lot of similarities between Your Name and Weathering\u2014they\u2019re love stories with similar fantastical elements, and share the idea of running away to the city to start a new life. Why did you choose to make a film that feels in many ways, similar to your prior work as your first big project after Your Name?\u00a0\nShinkai: The first thing I wanted to do with Weathering was to make a film on the theme of the weather. Firstly, because I\u2019d been watching the news of the more and more damage caused by the weather in Japan, and also because it\u2019s just such a familiar part of everyone\u2019s day-to-day life. The weather\u2014whether it\u2019s raining or sunny\u2014can have an impact on the way you feel that day. So I thought that it would be a theme that would really appeal to audiences. \nMore than 1 million people are being ordered to evacuate from southern Japan as an onslaught of\u2026\nI think the fact that both Weathering and Your Name have teenage protagonists is another similarity between them\u2014maybe creates a similar feeling. But I feel that animation is, in essence, something for young people. And I feel that young audience is renewed every three years or so, as people grow up and leave school. And so every three years or so you get a new, young generation [going to the movies]. And so I did feel like even if there were certain similarities with Your Name, it wouldn\u2019t really matter because it would be a new young audience coming to see it.\nio9: The fantastical themes of Weathering are much more grounded compared to Your Name. What inspired that choice?\nShinkai: I wanted to find the balance that would make the story really accessible to the audience, and that\u2019s how I came up with this depiction [of Hina\u2019s powers]. With Your Name, it was about body swapping. Which is obviously impossible, though still very enjoyable! But in this film, Hina is what we call in Japanese hare-onna\u2014which is quite hard to translate, but I\u2019ve gone with \u201csunshine girl\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s a very, very common concept in Japan. Lots of people might call themselves Sunshine Girl or Sunshine Boy or a Rain Girl or a Rain Boy, and it just means that when you\u2019re with that person, it usually ends up being sunny. But in this case, we\u2019ve taken that and obviously, this girl is a 100 percent sunshine girl\u2014so it\u2019s definitely going to be sunny when she\u2019s around. And so, it\u2019s something that is quite easy, I think, for a Japanese audience to go along with.\nio9: Tokyo is presented in such a loving lens in Weathering. What is it that draws you to depicting the city in this intimately personal way? What\u2019s your research process like in capturing it for one of your films?\nShinkai: First of all, I live in Tokyo myself and I wanted to depict the place I live as a beautiful place. Tokyo is a place that suffers from a lot of disasters caused by rains, caused by earthquakes\u2014it\u2019s not like London, where it looks as much today as it did 100 years ago. Tokyo is changing all the time, and I wanted to get Tokyo as I know it now down. In terms of how I went about creating Tokyo, I did location scouting, looked at the topography of Tokyo, tried to create those in 3D\u2014we went up by helicopter, got the data to create some 3D graphics. Those were some of the approaches I took.\nTyphoon Hagibis may now be a swirl of clouds near Alaska, but its impacts on Japan are still\u2026\nio9: You mention Tokyo as being this city greatly impacted by ecological disasters and the threat of climate change\u2014and obviously, Weathering With You carries a major ecological theme, as does your prior work. Do you feel an obligation to keep reminding people that Earth is in this period of environmental upheaval?\nShinkai: I have felt a kind of responsibility in the last few years. Climate change is happening. And in Japan, for example, I think we are entering a period where we can expect more earthquakes to happen. The Earth is relatively settled, but now, we\u2019re experiencing more earthquakes in Japan. And I think that\u00a0this\u00a0time I\u2019m living in gives me a kind of responsibility.\nWeathering With You hits theaters January 17.\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our Instagram @io9dotcom.\u00a0", "body_links": ["https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-best-and-five-worst-movies-of-2017-1821264928", "https://io9.gizmodo.com/weathering-with-you-is-a-gorgeous-earnest-romance-that-1840684713", "https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-your-name-remake-will-be-americanized-according-to-1831344790", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/more-than-a-million-ordered-to-evacuate-as-southern-jap-1836079763?_ga=2.95884510.355061355.1577737847-105069102.1526253072", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/typhoon-hagibis-is-japans-latest-multi-billion-dollar-d-1839031449?_ga=2.95884510.355061355.1577737847-105069102.1526253072", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/there-is-no-safe-global-warming-1840791544", "https://www.instagram.com/io9dotcom/"]},

It\u2019s human nature. \nAnd so perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve spent the past decade or so outlining what a \u201csafe\u201d level of global warming is. Language reflecting the conception of \u201csafe\u201d global heating abounds in scientific literature, climate negotiations, and the press. The Paris Agreement enshrined the idea that 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) as pretty safe. Advocacy from small island nations and others has made a compelling case that 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) would be safer still, allowing, at least, for their continued existence. At various times, each of these levels of heating have been called  a \u201cguardrail,\u201d \u201cdefence line,\u201d and \u201cbuffer zone.\u201d On one side, dangerous climate change. On the other, something we can figure out and adapt to if we play our cards right.\nRecently, the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold appears to have won out as our best bet for safety. And over the next decade, the world will decide its fate of whether it can limit heating to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. But we don\u2019t have to wait to find out if that level of heating is safe because the answer is right in front of us. Spoiler: It\u2019s not.\nScientific warnings about the risks of unchecked global warming have reached a crescendo in the\u2026\nAustralia\u2019s bushfires are a bright orange, smoke-spewing warning sign. The country just experienced its hottest year ever recorded, one where the annual average temperature edged 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The heat and accompanying drought are hallmarks of the climate crisis and key drivers of the bushfires that have charred more than 14.3 million acres this season. A quote in a 2014 story attributing then-unprecedented heat waves to climate change keeps rattling around in my head these days: Thomas Knutson, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told my then-colleague at Climate Central that Australia had \u201cleft behind the climate that they used to have.\u201d\nThat makes what\u2019s happening there an unnerving harbinger of what\u2019s to come for the rest of us in a world that has warmed roughly 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since we began burning fossil fuels in earnest. It\u2019s not that every region of the world will experience the same exact impacts as Australia at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. But the flames destroying Australia show the devastating impacts of the climate crisis on humans and the natural world and how brittle our systems are in the face of those impacts.\nConsider that an estimated 480 million animals have been killed, displaced, or otherwise affected by the bushfires over the past four months in New South Wales alone. Or that thousands of people were recently trapped on beaches under smoke-drenched, blood-red skies, the sea a last refuge as fires approached. (The Australian military eventually evacuated people by boat as part of the country\u2019s largest evacuation in history.) Or that an area the size of Vermont and New Hampshire have burned so far with worse fire conditions expected to end this week, all battled by volunteer (and until recently, unpaid) firefighters.\nNone of this could remotely be construed as \u201csafe\u201d unless you\u2019re a Big Oil chud. This is climate carnage, brought to you by fossil fuel companies that spent decades lying about the risks of their products and politicians carrying their water (or in Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s case, coal). Confronted with the overwhelming danger this relatively \u201csmall\u201d amount of global heating poses, those same forces are doubling down on the system that got us to this place and will rocket us into a more dangerous, deadly future.\nNone of this is to say we should give into climate doomerism (fuck you, Jonathan Franzen). Quite the opposite. Every degree of heating matters. So does every extra ton of carbon we chuck in the atmosphere.\nThe perils of our current altered climate should hasten the transition toward a no-carbon world and the \u201cfundamental societal and systems transitions and transformations\u201d the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls for to keep the planet from warming past the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. But as we work toward that, we also need to be clear-eyed that meeting that goal won\u2019t necessarily make the world a \u201csafe\u201d place for everyone. There will still be vulnerable people who will need help, disasters will still hit, and the climate at 1.5 degrees Celsius won\u2019t look like the one that allowed humanity to flourish. But it sure as hell is better than what\u2019s on the other side.

And this is only the first of the project\u2019s three platforms. Once all go online, the floating wind farm will be able to produce enough energy for about 60,000 homes a year. Like many European countries (including Denmark and the UK), Portugal has been investing heavily in wind as a viable clean energy option. \nIn 2017, wind energy made up most of the country\u2019s renewable energy production, but hydropower overtook wind\u2019s top spot in 2018, per the Directorate General for Energy and Geology data.

Now, the WindFloat Atlantic farm brings forth a new chapter in this technology. Smaller vessels were able to transport the necessary pieces for the project, which was installed on land instead of in the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear is the world needs more wind whether its onshore, offshore, or floating.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed to skip a carbon tax on this dangerous fossil fuel, according to documents Reuters reviewed. Given how urgent the climate crisis is becoming, the world simply cannot afford any more handouts to the coal industry.\nThat\u2019s especially true for India. The country deals with some of the worst air pollution on Earth. New Delhi, the Indian capital, is constantly choked by smog, forcing officials to close schools, shut down airports, and cut the number of cars on the road. Crop burning is mostly to blame, but so are the coal-fired power plants that fail to comply with emissions standards and spew illegal amounts pollutants into the air. Now, instead of having cleaner sources of energy compete fairly with coal, the Indian government is considering giving it a leg up so that it may wind up being the same price as\u2014if not cheaper than\u2014\u00a0wind and solar.\nThe government currently taxes coal production and imports at 400 rupees ($5.61) per metric ton. According to Reuters, the government wants to waive this carbon tax because \u201cthe savings would improve the financial health of utilities and distribution companies and help the power producers to install pollution-curbing equipment.\u201d Another concern is that the tax would cause electricity prices to rise, as well.\nDuring a pivotal moment in human history when we should be reducing global carbon emissions, a new\u2026\nThe Modi administration instead wants plants to install equipment that would cut pollution. However, a new and improved coal plant is still a coal plant. And coal will keep heating the world up to dangerous levels.\nThe Energy Information Administration warned in October that energy-related emissions may continue to rise until 2050 largely because of coal-loving countries such as India, China, and Indonesia. These countries turn to dirty fuels because it\u2019s cheaper and people need access to power. Countries in Europe and the U.S. have done very little to help poor and vulnerable nations turn away from coal despite pioneering its use and causing most of the historical emissions fueling the climate crisis.\nRecent international climate talks were another low point in this seemingly eternal gridlock, with wealthier nations led by the U.S. blocking any progress on helping poor countries. That puts leaders in rapidly developing countries like Modi in a place where they are forced to choose between what\u2019s good for the planet and what\u2019s good for the economic viability of his country, at least under our current economic system.\u00a0", "body_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-coal-tax-exclusive/exclusive-indian-pm-modis-office-proposes-waiving-carbon-tax-on-coal-idUSKBN1YY0PJ", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/new-years-eve-fireworks-in-sydney-will-go-ahead-despite-1840721811", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/antarctic-ice-melt-may-have-hit-an-all-time-high-on-chr-1840679498", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/2019-was-a-horror-show-year-for-weather-1840664679", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/how-to-fix-the-biggest-issue-plaguing-un-climate-talks-1840480211", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/closed-schools-delayed-flights-and-restricted-cars-i-1839607214", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/new-delhis-air-quality-is-so-bad-the-government-is-enli-1831341330", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/new-delhis-horrible-smog-is-back-heres-why-1830253076", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/new-delhis-air-pollution-went-off-the-scale-this-week-1826866425", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/farmers-blamed-delhi-s-pollution-say-they-are-helpless-n1078061", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-pollution-coal/india-pollution-regulator-threatens-to-shut-coal-fired-utilities-around-new-delhi-idUSKBN1Y21PI", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/worrying-report-shows-global-energy-related-emissions-m-1838662904", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-ends-with-a-whimper-1840447614"]},

The renewable energy source now makes up 47 percent of the country\u2019s energy consumption, heating the previous record set in 2017 of 43 percent.\nThis boost is, in large part, due to the launch of the country\u2019s largest offshore wind farm in the North Sea this year. The Horns Rev 3 wind farm generates enough energy to power about 425,000 Danish homes. The country has been quickly transitioning toward wind energy due to its location on the gusty North Sea. The sea\u2019s bountiful winds are also key to UK clean energy aspirations. The country went live with the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm last year.\nDenmark\u2019s left-wing coalition government took over in summer 2019 and upped the country\u2019s climate targets. They include reducing emissions 70 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Coal, oil, and gas still play a major role in meeting the country\u2019s energy consumption according to the Danish Energy Agency. But the wind energy revolution underway could very well help the country get emissions down by reducing the need for dirty energy.\nThe Danish aren\u2019t immune to the impacts of climate change. The country is projected to see more rain, more wind, and more extreme weather events. Though it only accounts for a fraction of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, it still has to bring them to zero along with every other country to avert the worst impacts of climate change.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is carrying on with a single offshore wind project. The U.S. could certainly learn from Denmark and embrace the sea breeze, and there are signs that the lackluster state of offshore wind could turn a corner soon. Presidential candidates such as Elizabeth Warren have made offshore wind investments key facets of their climate policy proposals.

And now, it\u2019s threatened employees who have publicly called on the company to do better without permission.\nA group of employees organized under the name Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AEJC) have been pushing the company to flesh out its climate plan and, in an open letter signed by more than 8,700 employees, use its heavyweight status to \u201cshift entire industries, inspire global action on climate, and lead on the issue of our lifetimes.\u201d CEO Jeff Bezos refused to even listen to them at last year\u2019s shareholder meeting. But in an escalation, Amazon HR threatened to fire some of the most outspoken members of the group for speaking with the press about their efforts.\nThe violations stem from speaking with the Washington Post for an October 10 article that covered, among other things, Amazon\u2019s weak climate pledge and commitment to keep working with extractive industries fueling the climate crisis. Maren Costa, a principal user-experience designer at Amazon, and Jamie Kowalski, an Amazon software development engineer, say they both received emails for speaking with the Post. Earther reviewed a copy of the email sent in late November, putting the employees on notice for violating the company\u2019s external communication policy and warning that \u201c[f]uture violations of the policy may result in formal corrective action, up to and including termination of your employment with Amazon.\u201d\nIn 2014, Amazon announced that it would power its rapidly expanding fleet of data centers with 100\u2026\nThe external communication policy in question\u2014which was also reviewed by Earther\u2014was updated on September 5, a day after employees sent an internal email about walking out as part of the massive September 20 global climate strike. While Earther was unable to review the policy before the update, the new policy says, \u201c[t]here must be a business justification for the communication, and it must have prior support from your manager and the VP whose business is primarily impacted.\u201d The policy goes on to note that the company\u2019s public relations department has to review all requests and it could \u201ctake up to two weeks for a response and/or approval.\u201d\n\u201cNow is a time when we need to have Communications policies that let us speak honestly about our company\u2019s role in the climate crisis,\u201d Costa said in a statement. \u201cThis is not the time to shoot the messengers. This is not the time to silence those who are speaking out.\u201d \nAn Amazon spokesperson told the Washington Post that its policy \u201cis not new and we believe is similar to other large companies.\u201d\nRather than telling its employees to shut up or risk termination, Amazon should perhaps spend more time talking about what it\u2019s going to do to address the climate crisis. The 2020s will be a crucial decade in climate action, and Amazon has the potential (for better or worse) to be a driving force one way or the other. \nThe company\u2019s cloud computing software, machine learning, and other resources are also used around the world, including by major oil companies. Cutting off access would be a huge blow to those companies and their efforts to extract more oil at a time when we need to be leaving fossil fuels in the ground. Amazon has explicitly pledged to keep working with those companies, though, and deals to do so have kept humming right along. Getting the company to change course would be a huge win for the climate.\nIn addition, Amazon has a massive supply chain and decarbonizing it could pay dividends for the climate. The company\u2019s climate plan aims for a goal of carbon neutrality by 2040, but it\u2019s light on details of how it will get there and the role carbon offsets could play. And in areas where it is clearer, it relies on some wishful thinking like putting 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road by 2024. Filling in more details and building in more accountability would go a long way toward Amazon showing it\u2019s serious.\nThe fact that the company has even set a carbon neutrality goal is largely due to the pressure of employees and not the kindness of Jeff Bezos\u2019 heart. Solving the climate crisis is an all-hands-on-deck endeavor, one that requires accountability and leadership. From Amazon\u2019s actions, it appears that leadership is in short supply at the top, and so pressure and leadership is coming from employees themselves who are turning the screws on a company that could do with feeling a little heat. As Rebecca Shepherd, a member of AECJ told Gizmodo when the company announced its climate plan:\n\u201cAmazon as a company asks for us to innovate, to disrupt, to think big, and to look at the numbers. I don\u2019t think anyone has demonstrated these core values better than Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. I believe that Jeff Bezos sees that and that is what prompted him to shift directions this morning, but we are far from done. This is one step of many and Amazon also tells us plans mean sh** if we don\u2019t deliver results.\u201d\nEarther has reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this post if we hear back.", "body_links": ["https://gizmodo.com/two-weeks-after-amazon-made-its-climate-pledge-it-join-1838944337", "https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-aggressively-pursuing-big-oil-as-it-stalls-ou-1833875828", "https://gizmodo.com/how-google-microsoft-and-big-tech-are-automating-the-1832790799?_ga=2.17407358.637979793.1577712079-248962609.1559160032", "https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate", "https://gizmodo.com/amazon-s-sweeping-climate-plan-is-full-of-gaping-holes-1838283067", "https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/public-letter-to-jeff-bezos-and-the-amazon-board-of-directors-82a8405f5e38", "https://gizmodo.com/jeff-bezos-wouldn-t-even-come-on-stage-to-listen-to-his-1834957220", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/11/amazon-policy-manifesto-responds-environmental-workplace-data-privacy-critics/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3", "https://gizmodo.com/amazon-s-sweeping-climate-plan-is-full-of-gaping-holes-1838283067", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/this-is-only-the-beginning-young-people-demand-justice-1838313449", "https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1212777102270820353", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/02/amazon-threatens-fire-outspoken-employee-critics-its-environmental-policies/", "https://gizmodo.com/nobody-listened-1840663763", "https://gizmodo.com/amazon-s-sweeping-climate-plan-is-full-of-gaping-holes-1838283067"]},

And now we get tone deaf tweets from Big Oil companies like ExxonMobil while the country goes up in flames.\nExxonMobil spent decades and millions of dollars fighting real climate policy reform, while secretly knowing exactly what was going to happen if the planet didn\u2019t curb carbon emissions. Back in 1982, Exxon scientists made predictions that match the reality of our current climate crisis\u2014predictions that we only know about now thanks to a 2015 investigation. And Australia is currently on the front lines of this human-caused emergency.\nMost recently, tourists in Australia\u2019s South Coast have been instructed to leave in a new advisory from local fire authorities and the local emergency management minister. To make things even worse, power is out and telecommunications channels are down in many parts of New South Wales, leaving many unsure how to call for help.\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service tweeted out an advisory today telling people to get the fuck out of the South Coast, because January 4 is going to be a perfect storm of heat and wind that will create a dangerous situation for miles.\n\u201cThese will be dangerous conditions, the same or worse than New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d the notice says.\nBut as many people are pointing out online, there\u2019s not always a way to escape. In fact, there are entire stretches along the highlighted areas where people aren\u2019t allowed to move. What\u2019s going to happen to the thousands of people who are trapped? We\u2019ll find out later this week, I guess.\nIn summary, thank you for your New Year\u2019s wishes, ExxonMobil. You helped create this mess.

And the 2019 heat record underscores this new reality, with Australia having gone up in smoke. \nThe ongoing bushfires have created a crisis over the past few months. The southeastern part of the country looks like a literal hellscape as bush fires continue to terrorize residents from Sydney to Adelaide.

Morrison\u2014a conservative who has pushed pro-coal policies that will cause the world to keep warming dangerously\u2014is now touring affected parts of the country, but no one seems to want him around. Instead, survivors have been telling the prime minister exactly how they feel\u2014and they\u2019re pissed. At one stop, Morrison was heckled until he left town. At others, he\u2019s forced people to shake his hand, including a very disturbed-looking firefighter. \nI don\u2019t blame the people for not wanting to shake the prime minister\u2019s hand or telling him how angry they are! At least 18 people have died, and 916 homes are in ruins as the flames engulf entire communities, according to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.

That\u2019s exactly what happened this week in Joshua Tree National Park after an extremely powerful storm ripped across the region.\nTo get snow in this corner of the Mojave Desert, you need two things normally in short supply for the region: cold temperatures and precipitation. The former isn\u2019t super rare. The average low in Joshua Tree during the winter months dip to near freezing, and the parts of the park in higher elevations get even colder. Precipitation, on the other hand, is tougher to find. The park averages a little less than 5.5 inches of precipitation in a year making it one of the driest places in the U.S. So, basically, getting snow in Joshua Tree is like rolling snake eyes. \nAnd that\u2019s exactly what the weather delivered this week thanks to a strong low-pressure system dropping out of the Gulf of Alaska. That provided the requisite frigid air (because Alaska) and precipitation (because gulf moisture) to bring a healthy helping of snow. The storm system set up camp off the Southern California coast and sent precipitation bands spiraling inland.\nEarth is the best planet, hands down. You should need no reminding of this, but on the off chance\u2026\nThe National Weather Service station just outside Joshua Tree recorded 1.23 inches of precipitation over a 24-hour period starting on Thursday into Friday, though it didn\u2019t report snowfall totals. But videos and photos from in and around the park show a healthy blast of snow. Heavy flakes ensconced the park\u2019s namesake trees and cacti that dot the desert, softening the Flintstones-esque landscape into something that looks more like Frozen. \nElsewhere in Southern California, the weather was equally ridiculous. Barstow, California,\u00a0set a December record with 1.76 inches of precipitation. In the high elevations of the San Bernardino Mountains, the snow totals were absolutely ridiculous with up to 36 inches of snow falling there. And in Ventura, the National Weather Service is investigating a tornado that touched down on Thursday.\nThe system has started to clear out of Southern California, but it\u2019s nowhere near done. Winter storm watches and warnings are up across parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Up to a foot of snow could fall in the mountains. Even low-elevation cities are under winter weather advisories including Tucson where the foothills could see up to three inches of snow.

The big meltdown hit on Christmas Eve and is bad news for a continent already dealing with a lot. With summer is just getting started there, this is a serious case of Summertime Sadness.\nAntarctic is the largest stash of ice on the planet. Warm oceans have posed the biggest threat to that ice by undercutting the ice shelves that float out into the sea, particularly the tongues of ice around West Antarctica. But surface melt could become a bigger concern, and the Christmas Eve meltdown is indicative of the concerns. Preliminary findings from modeling done at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium show that the percentage of surface melt on the continent spiked on December 24. The modeling uses weather forecasts to simulate surface melt. Because the environment is so harsh in Antarctica, weather station data is tough to come by so these are best estimates.\nAntarctic surface melt season starts in mid-November and runs into February. Late December and early January are the height of the melt season. On average, just eight percent of Antarctica\u2019s surface melts at the peak. But this year has been anything but average, with everyday since late November showing well above normal surface melt extent. That culminated in a big melt spike on Christmas Eve when about 16 percent of the continent\u2019s icy surface went into meltdown. \nThat\u2019s an area equivalent to the size of Denmark. West Antarctica\u2014home to some of the most endangered ice on the planet\u2014has seen the worst of the melt season according to the University of Li\u00e8ge data. But even the normally colder and higher East Antarctic hasn\u2019t escaped a more watery fate.\nWhen the surface melts, a glaze of ice can form when it refreezes. But if enough ice melts, then the melt can cause water to start pooling on the surface or flowing and sneaking into ice cracks,  where it can fracture the ice apart. Scientists have observed this in the heart of Antarctica, but Antarctic Peninsula has had it the worst.\nRobin Bell, a geophysics professor at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told Earther that if this melt continues or worsens, it could hasten the collapse of the ice shelves already under threat from below. And that could pose serious risks to people who live along the coast by allowing land ice to tumble into the sea.\n\u201c[The ice shelves are] kind of like the cork in the bottle. They\u2019re holding back a lot of the ice in Antarctica,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt means you\u2019re pumping more ice into the ocean, and that\u2019s what matters for sea level.\u201d\nAntarctic is unfortunately not the only stash of ice to be dealing with more extreme melt season. Researchers have observed the same phenomenon in Greenland as well. This summer\u2019s melt season set a record for daily ice loss as a result of surface melting. Greenland has been the main contributor to sea level rise. With Antarctica\u2019s ice loss accelerating, we\u2019re starting to get into dangerous territory.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/antarctica-is-losing-an-unfathomable-amount-of-ice-1826799202", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/scientists-just-found-another-vulnerability-in-antarcti-1820046047", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/future-el-ninos-could-spell-trouble-for-antarcticas-mos-1821871261", "http://climato.be/cms/index.php?climato=the-2020-melt-season-over-antarctica-as-simulated-by-marv3-10", "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22049", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12039-2", "http://nsidc.org/greenland-today/2019/11/large-ice-loss-on-the-greenland-ice-sheet-in-2019/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/greenland-lost-12-5-billion-tons-of-ice-in-record-break-1836940971", "https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/global-sea-level/ice-melt"]},

Which yes, the rule would\u2019ve forced incandescent bulb makers to innovate while trying to lower costs. That\u2019s how good regulations ensure the market works. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette in a statement accompanying the rules change that \u201c[i]nnovation and technology are already driving progress.\u201d The rolled back rule would\u2019ve sped along that innovation but OK, sure. Whatever.\nYou know what I choose to light my home? Philips Hue Smart Bulbs. I don\u2019t have to worry about them making me look too orange because I can make the light any color I want. Oh, and energy-efficient LED bulbs like mine save me nearly five times the annual savings than if I were using whack ass incandescent bulbs. \nThe Department of Energy itself has said energy-efficient bulbs can save homeowners $75 each year. Incandescent bills will cost, on average, about $4.80 a year in energy costs. LEDs like mine? A dollar! These newer bulbs do cost more upfront, but the average person doesn\u2019t have to be a bougie bitch like me and buy smart bulbs. Buy a regular-ass LED! And save money on your energy bill!\nWe\u2019re also already on track to convert to LEDs around the U.S., as Trump\u2019s peeps were sure to note. By 2035, LEDs should make up 84 percent of all lighting.\nThe consequences of this rollback won\u2019t make or break the fight to protect the planet, but it will make the transition toward energy efficiency that much longer and harder. The announcement feels oddly timely as people celebrate the holidays with extra colorful lights decorating their homes and yards. In fact, all the energy we use lighting up our cribs for the holiday season results in more energy usage than some countries (such as El Salvador, where my roots lie) do in a year! A year! That\u2019s insane. And yet another good argument for why LEDs make sense.\n So what\u2019s the issue then in ensuring incandescents don\u2019t take up space in our store aisles? What is your obsession with lightbulbs, Trump!? And why do you hate the cool new ones so much?\nI truly don\u2019t understand, but I guess the president loves doing everything possible to continue his war against the planet.

There\u2019s an argument to be made that we should do everything possible to save the ice, and a new study explores a very controversial idea to that end: cooling the planet.\nThe findings, published last month in Earth\u2019s Future, explore what would happen if the world pumped particles high into the atmosphere that would reflect sunlight back into space. This high-altitude air conditioning scheme, known as solar radiation management or SRM, would bring down the global average temperature. The paper\u2019s results show that cooling would help slow\u2014though not stop\u2014the melting of the ice sheet. That could buy coastal regions time but also change the climate in other ways that may end up hurting other regions around the world.\nGeoengineering is the bogeyman of climate policy, a word that calls to mind skies bleached sulphur\u2026\nThe threats to Greenland ice are coming from seemingly all directions. Relatively hot water has undercut the glaciers tumbling down from the ice sheet, while rising air temperatures have melted it from above. Recent wildfires have also left a cake of dark soot that absorbs more sunlight, enhancing surface melt. And then there are surface pools of water that funnel into cracks in the ice, further destabilizing it. In short, climate change is engaged in an all-out war on the ice sheet that will only intensify in the coming century. Projections indicate the ice sheet melting could lead to anywhere from 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) of sea level rise this century, with much higher rates of rise in the Pacific.\n To understand the impact geoengineering could have on Greenland, scientists ran models that simulate the climate throughout the century under a few different scenarios. In some scenarios, greenhouse gas pollution increased throughout the century or peaked by mid-century. They then took those same scenarios and added in a splash of geoengineering. The models they ran basically shot particles into the stratosphere around the equator that then dispersed around the globe. The impacts are based in part on what happens after volcanic eruptions, and the study used the equivalent a quarter of a Pinatubo eruption every year.\nThe results show that the planet-cooling properties of the particles would extend to Greenland, lowering air temperatures there by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the scenarios without geoengineering. Runoff from melt would drop anywhere from 20 to 32 percent, with the biggest difference coming under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. All that means sea level rise would slow.\nDoug MacMartin, a Cornell scientist who has studied geoengineering, told Earther the study\u2019s findings were in line with you\u2019d expect from solar radiation management but that the findings used older models. Future work updated with new models could go a long way to building on the findings, and the study itself notes that some key aspects of atmospheric circulation are simplified.\nBut it\u2019s not all puppies and unicorns. Geoengineering alone wouldn\u2019t be able to stop ice from melting. It could also wreak havoc with weather in other parts of the globe, potentially pitting nations against each other. And then there\u2019s the most concerning aspect of geoengineering, which is that once we start in on cooling the planet, stopping it could risk sudden, catastrophic climate change. So any plan to do this requires a long, hard think and making sure everyone has a say, not just rich countries with tons of coastal real estate.\n\u201cCould geoengineering affect the Arctic? How effective would it be at offsetting projected polar changes due to climate change? Would there be any side effects or unintended consequences?\u201d Ben Kravitz, a geoengineering researcher at Indiana University, told Earther in an email. \u201cAnswering these questions is critical, and this study is a welcome step in addressing such questions.\u201d\nIndeed, as the world continues to put off the best climate change solution (which would be cutting emissions), it moves closer to considering more risky ways to address the changes set in motion by decades of unbridled fossil fuel use. That makes exploring these ideas in the scientific literature terrifying and important all at once.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about [solar radiation management] today, but we don\u2019t want to be in a position of making hasty choices some point in the future\u2014which is exactly why studies like this one are so important,\u201d MacMartin told Earther in an email.\nEqually important, and something that MacMartin emphasized as well, is actually doing the hard work of cutting carbon emissions. As the results make clear, blocking out sunlight is nowhere near enough to protect the coasts.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/greenland-lost-12-5-billion-tons-of-ice-in-record-break-1836940971", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/greenland-is-now-losing-ice-six-times-faster-than-it-wa-1834215872", "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001393", "https://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/7964", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/cracks-in-greenlands-ice-sheet-may-be-making-it-even-mo-1840174664", "https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/scientists-maybe-if-we-only-dim-the-sun-a-little-it-wo-1833203941", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/once-we-start-geoengineering-we-wont-be-able-to-stop-1822300410"]},

I love the coquito, the lights, and Christmas music. In fact, I\u2019m listening to Kacey Musgraves\u2019 Christmas album as I write this. \nThe holidays also bring out one of my biggest vices: gift wrap. Every year, I look forward to picking out some metallic, snowflake-covered wrapping paper and enlisting my nephew to help me wrap all this year\u2019s presents. \nWrapping is a fine art, and the right wrapping paper can make or break a perfectly wrapped present. This year, however, I\u2019ve come to terms with how this art can create unnecessary waste and environmental destruction. I\u2019m finally in my own place with a loving partner, and I want us to lead a life we\u2019re proud of now that I have full reign over household decisions. I\u2019m also trying to make better financial decisions, and spending at least $30 on gift wrap seems... dumb. That\u2019s why I changed up my Christmas routine and decided not to spend ridiculous amounts of money on the beautiful papers I adore. Instead, I opted for something a lot more simple.\nWhile I strive to be a steward of Earth, I am far from perfect. This means that a lot of my Christmas shopping over the last month was done online. I didn\u2019t opt for any overnight or two-day shipping, though, which really shoots up shipping emissions. But I did end up with a good number of cardboard boxes. For the most part, I left many items in the boxes they came in. For those that didn\u2019t come boxed, I put most of them back into the shipping boxes. And I spruced them all up a bit.\nThe holiday season is upon us. That means warm hot chocolates, winter tunes, and all the\u2026\nAll my Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods paper bags I hoard in shame as reminders of the moments I forget my reusable grocery bags came through this year. I wrapped most gifts in these leftover brown grocery bags, which are recyclable or compostable. I neatly opened up the bags so they resemble a single sheet of paper. Then, I cut off the edges with two layers of paper, as well as the handles. Voila, instant wrapping paper.\nBuying new bows was out of the question. Luckily, I have a bunch of decorative tape from my days of scrapbooking that I used to give some shine to the paper bag wrapping paper. To add even more holiday cheer, I gathered the small branches that had fallen off my Christmas tree and tucked one into the corner of each present. Honestly, that little pop of green went a long way in helping my presents look more than plain brown boxes.\nThat being said, not all my boxes could fit my presents\u2014and some don\u2019t go in a box. For instance, I got my friend a carrying pouch for her AirPods. It\u2019s an odd shape. So I wrapped it in brown paper but tied it on top to make it look like a little pouch. I used the bag handle to tie it on top and added some decorative tape and a sticker I had lying around to make it  a little cuter. I also had leftover Christmas bags that I re-used for some clothes that wouldn\u2019t fit in any of my boxes. \nThe wrapping job on these might not compete with that cool aunt\u00a0who always goes above and beyond with the ribbons and bows, but does anyone even care about all that? Most people rip off the wrapping paper and other decorations and immediately throw that shit out. \nThis is my first time trying to sustainably wrap gifts, and I want to be more thoughtful about it next year. That\u2019s why I\u2019m planning to add a little note with all my presents next year informing my family and friends why I\u2019m taking this route: Gift wrap is bad for the planet. \nExhibit A: The trash Americans create between Thanksgiving and Christmas increases by more than 25 percent. Exhibit B: Reusing materials helps! A lot. Wrapping even three presents in re-used material could save enough paper to cover 45,000 football fields.\n Paper trash is problematic because it can emit methane. Remember, paper comes from trees, and when they break down, they release this greenhouse gas! That\u2019s why we must recycle paper, but not all of the pretty holiday wraps are recyclable. And recycling doesn\u2019t always work.\nAnd really, the gift and thought is what ultimately matters! Who cares what it comes in.\nMaybe my choices and note explaining them will get my friends and family thinking about their own choices. I know choosing not to buy wrapping paper isn\u2019t going save the planet. That\u2019s going to require big, structural changes. But it does given me hope that one day, we can actually live in a world where the holidays aren\u2019t so wasteful and driven by the need to spend copious amounts of money. Maybe we can live\u2014happily, may I add\u2014in a world where we change our everyday habits and routines in order to play a small part in solving\u00a0the climate crisis.

Credit where it\u2019s due, those slow-walkin\u2019, kamboosha-sippin\u2019 hippies out in California was onta something with their highly successful single-use plastic bag ban. So much so, in fact, that we err, \u201cborrowed\u201d the idea ourselves. Now personally? I dunno how I feel about a New Yawk with less litter. This city\u2019s practically built on garbage.

To be fair, I want to see Cats (ideally the non-patched version), but I\u2019ve been a bit busy with the holidays and whatnot. But I have read Alex Cranz\u2019s io9 review of the original and patched movie describing it \u201clike a corpse flower... utterly awful but absolutely captivating\u201d as well as the Wikipedia page and I understand the atmosphere enough to be able to comment on the one real thing in Cats.\nAnd that thing is a central part of Cats\u2019 plot: the competition to reach the Heaviside Layer. Well, not the competition part. But the layer itself is an actual thing, and it\u2019s an important one in the scope of human history. \nI witnessed Cats for you. You weak people with your finite resources and lack of desire to spend\u2026\nIt\u2019s not full of cats in various states of Nirvana, though. No cat could survive a trip to the actual Heaviside layer without a special suit or vessel to protect against both freezing and sweltering temperatures and a lack of oxygen. The Heaviside layer is a real part of the upper reaches of the atmosphere known as the ionosphere. It sits anywhere from 50-90 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface, and it\u2019s discovery in the early 1900s helped explain a crucial part of how radio waves do their thing.\nBack then, radio transmission was a relatively new thing. But scientists were puzzled as to why they didn\u2019t just shoot off into space but instead followed the Earth\u2019s curvature. Oliver Heaviside, a British engineer, hypothesized there was a layer in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere that essentially helped radio waves skim around the planet. The hypothesis was proven correct and thus the Heaviside Layer was born. \nOther researchers independently hypothesized the layer existed around the same time as well, including American engineer Arthur Kennelly. In a righteous letter to the journal Nature in 1925, yet another engineer named Alexander Russell put the world of radio nerds on blast: \u201cIf names are to be attached to this hypothetical layer it should be called, in equity, the \u2018Kennelly-Heaviside\u2019 layer, a name which is beginning to be used in America.\u201d\nTell \u2018em, Alex.\nAnyways, there you have it. The Heaviside Layer is real and easily explainable.

And unfortunately, 2019 was a painful reminder of that.\nSevere storms, wildfires, and cyclones have left communities around the world to deal with damage that could, at least in some cases, never be undone. The destructive weather of 2019 also revealed the yawning chasm between how the rich and poor experience the impacts of climate change. \nWhile some wealthier countries were hit hard by weather disasters\u2014the U.S., for example, saw multibillion-dollar crop losses and infrastructure damage due to spring flooding, and some farmers are still digging out\u2014poorer countries bore a disproportionate burden. Mozambique\u2019s subsistence farmers were in a harder spot than their American counterparts before twin cyclone struck this year. In the months since, they haven\u2019t had nearly the level of assistance as impacted Americans, and food insecurity has spread throughout the country. Without international assistance, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network forecast shows Mozambique would be facing emergency or crisis-level food insecurity levels, the latter just a step below famine.\nThis isn\u2019t to say American farmers who lost everything or families that lost a relative in the recent European heat waves made out good. Extreme weather\u2014and by extension, climate change\u2014means we all suffer. What 2019 showed is that nobody can escape. With the dawn of a new decade, we have a lot of work to do to ensure we prepare for and respond to our increasingly dangerous weather in ways that are just.\nThere was a lot of terrible weather this year, but not all of it was destructive. Before diving into the real Bad Shit, let\u2019s talk about some weirdo storms that saved their worst for the sea. That makes them the best kind of record-setters, meteorological marvels you can gawk at without feeling too guilty.\nHurricane Lorenzo formed in September and became the strongest storm ever recorded so far north and east in the Atlantic. It cranked up to a Category 5 at its most intense when it was well out to sea. It later weakened as it whipped by the Azores and plowed into Ireland as an extratropical storm, adding another layer of weirdness.\nThe Indian Ocean had a weirdo as well when Cyclone Kyarr spun up in October. It became the strongest storm on Earth during a period of rapid intensification. The storm\u2019s central pressure dipped to 915 millibars, setting a new record for the Arabian Sea. It didn\u2019t have much impact on land, making it a good freak storm.\nThis year, unfortunately, continued a string of horrible Atlantic hurricane seasons. While Tropical Depression Imelda drenched Texas and Tropical Storm Barry gave New Orleans a brush with disaster, the worst storm of the season was easily Hurricane Dorian. The storm cranked up to a Category 5 and then slowed to a crawl over the Bahamas. \nDorian\u2019s Category 5 winds raked the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco for hours on end. Storm surge came rushing inland and rains pummeled the islands. When the storm had passed, devastation extended as far as the eye could see, communities had been wiped clean off the map, and forests were turned to toothpicks. The winds ripped an oil facility to shreds, sending toxic oil into freshwater resources ensuring the impacts will last for decades. And the destruction also likely wiped out an endangered bird, ensuring the impacts will last forever.\nThe only thing worse than one powerful cyclone is two. That\u2019s exactly what Mozambique, one of the least developed countries in the world, dealt with in a little more than a month. Cyclone Idai hit the country in March as a Category 4 monster and became the deadliest tropical storm ever recorded in the southern hemisphere while leaving large parts of the country\u2019s fourth-largest city in ruins. Idai\u2019s rains essentially created an inland lake, sparking a food security issue that was compounded when Cyclone Kenneth made landfall roughly five weeks later. Despite clear, widespread suffering, donors had barely kicked in half of what was needed for recovery a few months later. If it\u2019s any indication of a future with more disasters, the pre-existing gaps in development and who suffers most will only grow.\nThe U.S. set the record for its wettest 12-month period multiple times this year. But nowhere was soggier than the Midwest, which saw epic winter snow turn into epic spring floods that were then worsened by epic rainstorms that also spawned widespread tornadoes. Rivers overtopped into farmers\u2019 fields and rushing waters scraped away topsoil that took centuries to build up. Tribes and Superfund sites were also hit hard. The record snow and rain are part of a larger flooding crisis in the U.S. where heavy rain is becoming more common due to climate change. You can bet this isn\u2019t the last time we see the breadbasket underwater.\nHeat waves are one of the clearest signs of the building climate crisis, and Europe was the epicenter of heat for the second year in a row. A series of blistering heat waves broke records across Europe from France to the UK, to the Czech Republic. Despite the record-setting heat, the continent didn\u2019t see a repeat of the tragic 2003 heat waves that left tens of thousands dead. It shows that with proper financing and the political will, you can stop dangerous weather from turning deadly. That\u2019s a sharp contrast to Mozambique and shows why the world needs a more equitable solution the climate crisis\nThere\u2019s no other way to end this list. This was the year of fire with seemingly every corner of the globe ablaze. The Arctic? Lit up. The Amazon? Smoking. Indonesia? Charred to a crisp. The UK? Record-setting blazes. Australia? Still very much on fire.\nSure, some of these fires aren\u2019t \u201cwildfires\u201d in the sense that they didn\u2019t have natural causes. Farmers, miners, and criminal gangs intentionally set fire to the Amazon, for example. But that doesn\u2019t mean the fires there aren\u2019t connected to the weather. Those same Amazon fires blotted out the sun in S\u00e3o Paulo. But more dramatically, the trees going up in smoke there and elsewhere around the world are releasing decades\u2014and sometimes even centuries\u2014of stored carbon into the atmosphere. That means that the fires of the future will be even worse.\nEven the fires that didn\u2019t ignite show how our new weatherscape has changed us. In 2018, extreme fire conditions in California coupled with a few downed power lines led to the largest and most destructive fires in state history. This year, utilities facing similar circumstances cut the power to millions in order to avoid a repeat. The wildfire season this year was much less eventful (though not without dangerous fires), but the blackouts led to mass confusion, lost wages, and other impacts that show adapting to our increasingly fiery landscapes will require more than just cutting the power and hoping for the best.

A koala stands next to him, in the remnants of a puddle of water ostensibly leftover from the dripping fire hose. It\u2019s one of the most gripping images of the Australian bushfire crisis, but it\u2019s also a shocking metaphor for the climate chaos we face as the world enters a crucial decade.\nIn a Facebook Messenger message, the fire service told Earther the photo was taken near Lobethal, South Australia, last week. The community sits about 16 miles east of downtown Adelaide, the state\u2019s capital city. While the bushfire crisis has centered on the state of New South Wales (and around Sydney in particular), South Australia has also seen catastrophic fires. \nVideo shot on a flight into Adelaide at night last week show the countryside lit up orange and red as far as the eye can see. At least 86 homes and 500 other structures have been burned to the ground in the state as of Monday morning, with the State Premier Steven Marshall telling ABC News Breakfast that \u201cthe catastrophic conditions we had on Friday were just extraordinary.\u201d\nThe flames have been fueled by record-breaking heat across the country. The country\u2019s average daily high last week hit 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday to set the record only for a new record to be set on Wednesday, which saw a high of 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7 degrees Celsius). Add in intense drought, and you have a recipe for catastrophe.\nAs the country burns, koalas have been central to the story of Australia\u2019s fires. Motorists have stopped to offer them water and save them from the flames. Even dogs have joined the cause. Not all of the adorable marsupials singed by the flames and roasted by the heart has survived, though.\nThat\u2019s what makes this photo so instantly iconic, defining the bushfires\u2019 impact on both humans and wildlife. Even as firefighters\u2014many of whom are volunteers\u2014have done their best to turn back the flames, the conditions on the ground have just been too overwhelming. People and wildlife have lost their homes as a result, and their lives may never be the same after the summer of 2019. The pathos on display in this photo neatly captures all of that.\nBut the photo is also a microcosm of the climate-fueled chaos gripping the world. This year has made it clearer than ever we are living through a climate emergency that threatens everything we hold dear. The flames are at our collective doorstep, and yet the world has so far been hamstrung from making any meaningful moves to address it largely due to the influence of large fossil fuel corporations and a few governments looking to wring the final bits out of the fossil fuel-driven economy. (Australia is one of those countries).\nThere\u2019s an uprising underway to combat this inaction and put the world on a pathway toward a future that balances human existence with nature. But right now, it\u2019s staring at the wall of flames. To me, this photo is a snapshot of our present. \nWhat we need are reinforcements to turn the tide on the advance fire. Whether they arrive in time will be the story of the next decade. We know what that picture needs to look like. How it develops is up to us.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/sydney-is-choking-on-the-most-toxic-air-on-earth-1840337199", "https://twitter.com/timhatfield87/status/1208167864869490688", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-23/adelaide-hills-bushfire-has-destroyed-86-homes,-sa-premier-says/11822552", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/water-thieves-steal-80-000-gallons-in-australia-as-our-1840549648", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/people-and-dogs-unite-to-save-koalas-from-australias-ho-1839967306", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/beloved-koala-famous-for-viral-rescue-has-been-put-down-1840050041", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-oxford-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-matters-this-ti-1839970234", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/australian-prime-minister-will-return-from-vacation-to-1840535037"]},

But it turns out a good chunk of the planning going on behind the scenes was done by someone with a little more power: Washington State Representative Matt Shea.\nA new report commissioned by the Washington House of Representatives dove into Shea\u2019s background and found he \u201cparticipated in an act of domestic terrorism against the United States.\u201d Shea also took part in Nevada standoff with right-wing extremists who refused to pay fees for grazing on federal lands. If you\u2019re a Washingtonian, these are your tax dollars hard at work. If you\u2019re an American, this is a view of the environmental fringe creeping closer to the heart of the Republican party.\nThe report is a damning indictment of Shea\u2019s connection with right-wing extremists who want to dissolve the federal government\u2019s land management agencies and turn the West back into the Wild West. It shows Shea actively planned the takeover of the refuge, communicated with extremist groups using encrypted messaging, and offered to use his powers to run background checks on political rivals. \nShea called the Malheur takeover \u201cOperation Cold Reality,\u201d and provided what he described as a \u201cmilitary style planning brief\u201d to the domestic terrorists who took over the refuge, the report found. It also shows he shuttled information to militia members about actions law enforcement was planning and referred to the Bureau of Land Management as \u201cterrorists\u201d even as he engaged in what the report characterized as terrorist activity. His communications were authored under his code name \u201cverumbellator,\u201d which is Latin for \u201ctrue warrior.\u201d\nThe whole standoff designed by the true warrior ended up not going so great. People sent a bunch of dildos and there was some beef between militia members. More seriously, the standoff ended with dozens of arrests and law enforcement killing one of the participants after a high-speed chase.\nShea\u2019s close involvement in the Malheur Wildlife Refuge confrontation is only a fraction of the 108-page report. In addition to facility a terrorist takeover of federal land, it found, Shea also outlined the \u201cBiblical Basis for War that advocated for the replacement of US democracy with a theocracy and killing of all males who do not agree,\u201d and advocating for destroying the U.S. and replacing it with a theocracy that sounds an awful lot like the Gilead in the Handmaids\u2019 Tale. He also said in a Signal message to militia members and leaders that talk about sending Kier\u00e1n Suckling, the head of the Center for Biological Diversity, a wolf tail and balls was \u201cnot something to put out electronically. We need to meet f2f [face-to-face].\u201d\nAll of this is, patently, fucked up and chilling. Shea, after all, is an elected official trying to overthrow the government. Washington\u2019s Republican leaders have said Shea should resign, stripped him of his assignments, and scrubbed him from their website. It\u2019s easy to write off Shea as an outlier since extremists are by definition extreme.\nBut to write him off as a lone wolf or total weirdo is to ignore the reality the Republican Party is turning into in 2019. The idea of \u201ctaking back\u201d land has been alive and well in the Republican Party at the federal level for years and had proponents like Rob Bishop, the chair of the freaking House Natural Resources Committee, until Republicans lost in the 2018 midterms (he\u2019s still the ranking member). It\u2019s basically just a politer, less violent version of Shea\u2019s views.\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even begin to scratch the surface of the violence of Republican climate denial and the pain it inflicts on vulnerable populations. Republican state senators in Oregon went on the lam earlier this year to stave off a vote on cap-and-trade legislation, a market-based solution that was Republican-based orthodoxy in the 1990s. The Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory push has done damage to science, communities of color, and the global climate. Ditto for Republicans\u2019 bad faith responses to the Green New Deal. This is violence by inaction and delay. It may not come with a side of AK-toting, flag-wielding cosplay, but it\u2019s just as\u2014and in some ways\u2014more destructive.", "body_links": ["https://splinternews.com/and-now-homoerotic-oregon-militia-fanfiction-1793853965", "http://gawker.com/angry-militia-leader-stop-mailing-us-dildos-1752580458", "https://gawker.com/drama-alert-the-oregon-militia-boys-are-beefing-like-i-1751917762", "https://twitter.com/jtwilcox111/status/1207817397303820289?s=20", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/20/gop-legislator-matt-shea-coordinated-anti-government-land-occupation-oregon/", "https://www.outsideonline.com/2188486/public-lands-enemy-number-one", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/oregon-climate-bill-appears-dead-after-some-ridiculous-1835847514", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-worst-environmental-rollbacks-of-2019-1840518827", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/green-new-deal-voted-down-in-senate-after-some-real-bul-1833582102"]},

But even with no clear timeline for when construction would begin on the mountain\u2019s sacred slopes, protestors have said they have every intent of continuing to protect\u00a0the dormant volcano.\n\u201cOne thing is clear, no matter the state\u2019s plans, we will be here to protect the Mauna,\u201d Pu\u2019uhonua o Pu\u2019uhuluhulu, the group camping at the access road to Mauna Kea, wrote on Twitter.\nKealoha Pisciotta used to journey up Mauna Kea in Hawaii for work.

Protestors said that after Ige\u2019s announcement, officers told them they had until December 26 to clear the road or they\u2019d be arrested.\n\u201cAfter spending $15 million dollars on law enforcement operations since July, the state has decided they will continue to incur more by threatening a sweep if Kia\u02bbi [protectors] remain till the 26th,\u201d the group went on via Twitter.\nGiven the months-long protest to get to this point, it\u2019s unlikely Native Hawaiians will back down. The fight for Mauna Kea is the latest front in a fight over Native Hawaiian land rights and the way state-sanction institutions have dispossessed people without informed consent. \nPartners on the project have been trying for years to secure its development, but opponents won\u2019t let up. As a result, those partners\u2014which include California Institute of Technology and National Astronomical Observatory of Japan\u2014have secured permits for a site on one of the Spanish Canary Islands and are considering whether to move construction there. The group says Mauna Kea would be a superior site to view the cosmos, and the team is still dedicated to building the telescope here. But as the protests have been drawn out, they\u2019ve had to prepare for an alternative if construction becomes impossible.\nThe telescope has opened up divisions in the scientific community. Hundreds of astronomers have sided with the protestors, noting that science is not more important than human rights. Sure, this telescope would create the ability to gaze ever deep into the universe, but at what cost to people on Earth and the places they hold sacred?\nI wanna learn about the universe\u2019s creation just as much as the next person, but when a community pushes back, the scientific community needs to listen. For many of these opponents, Mauna Kea isn\u2019t just a mountain. She\u2019s a relative. She\u2019s family. She\u2019s the burial grounds of other ancestors, and, the way they see it, she deserves to be seen as more than a construction site.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/hundreds-of-protestors-block-work-crews-ahead-of-thirty-1836443987", "https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/latest-news/office-of-the-governor-statement-by-governor-david-ige-on-mauna-kea-tmt/", "https://twitter.com/puuhuluhulu/status/1207897643860447234", "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/12/19/hawaii-news/hawaii-police-to-stand-down-from-telescope-construction-site/", "https://twitter.com/puuhuluhulu/status/1207892043583766528", "https://www.kitv.com/story/41351371/spain-granted-permits-to-build-tmt-if-moved-from-hawaii", "https://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2019/09/05/astronomers-refute-claim-that-canary-islands-comparable-to-mauna-kea-for-tmt/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/hundreds-of-astronomers-denounce-arrest-of-native-hawai-1836497851"]},

Truly, these are all terrible and terribly stupid things to say.\nBut in the lexicon of the Trump administration, we now have the definitive word on what the worst phrase is. On Tuesday, the Plain English Foundation declared \u201cfreedom gas\u201d the worst words of the year. The group bills itself as \u201cthe authority in clear communication,\u201d and I have no reason to doubt this as their word choice is inspired. \nThe Department of Energy included that fateful phrase in a May 2019 press release about natural gas, attributing the phrase to Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes. \n\u201cIncreasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America\u2019s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,\u201d Menzes said before talking about \u201cmolecules of freedom.\u201d\nClimate change is rapidly bending everything, including our language. \nHonestly, \u201cmolecules of freedom\u201d would be my choice for worst phrase of the year. It sounds like the name of a wretched, fascist tribute band of supergroup Atoms for Peace. But alas, I\u2019m just a humble blogger. Let\u2019s hear what Neil James, the executive director of the authority in clear communication, had this to say about their choice:\n\u201cWhen a simple product like natural gas starts being named through partisan politics, we are entering dangerous terrain. Why can\u2019t natural gas just remain natural gas?\u201d\nToo true, Neil. Too true. \nThis isn\u2019t even the administration\u2019s first flirtation with freedom fuels. Last year, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC that American fracked gas was the \u201ckind of freedom that is priceless.\u201d Mastercard, eat your heart out.\nBut while Trump\u2019s toilet riff is kinda funny (aside from having to think about our president taking a 15-flush dump), the attempt to rebrand natural gas as some kind of patriotic duty is an Orwellian nightmare. The U.S. has flooded the world with natural gas over the past decade or so thanks to advances in fracking. This is hardly liberating. Instead, it\u2019s made the world more dependent on gas with many utilities infrastructure meant to last for decades.\nExtracting and burning natural gas releases carbon dioxide and methane, a greenhouse gas that\u2019s way more potent than carbon dioxide (and which the Trump administration wants to deregulate). The more the world burns, the more it worsens the climate emergency. Again, not exactly freedom.\nIn fact, if we\u2019re going to rebrand natural gas, how about make it \u201cunnatural gas\u201d for the world it\u2019s creating.

Lots of environmentalists are pissed because it barely did anything for renewable energy. Tax breaks for onshore wind energy got a yearlong extension, but offshore wind and solar didn\u2019t get shit.\nWell, we at Earther are here to tell you that it\u2019s okay! Because even though our representatives didn\u2019t prioritize renewable energy\u2014the thing humanity needs more of to get out of the climate crisis alive\u2014they boldly fought to preserve other crucial tax breaks. \nInternational climate talks kicked off on Monday in Madrid, and a delegation of House Democrats\u2026\nTax breaks for craft distillers, for instance, got a much-needed yearlong extension. Since the United Nation\u2019s climate talks ended on Sunday without delivering any ambitious new targets, my existential dread has been through the roof, and all these crazy stories about Australia\u2019s deadly bushfires and record-breaking heatwave haven\u2019t been helping\u2014I know I\u2019m not alone! I generally think the best way representatives could ease our collective climate anxiety is by facilitating the transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible. But honestly, I could also really use a drink. So yes, tax breaks for liquor distilleries, breweries, and wineries, please.\nI could also use a reliable way to get away really fast if I\u2019m in the middle of a crazy flood\u2014the kind happening far more often due to climate change. The problem is, cars emit tons of greenhouse gases. Even electric cars can run on fossil fuels depending on the source, so they\u2019re not perfect! That must be why representatives didn\u2019t extend any tax breaks for electric car owners, and instead decided to prioritize tax breaks for racehorse owners. I\u2019m looking forward to riding away from a 100-year flood in style, on horseback. Thanks, Capitol Hill!\nBut say you\u2019re not into horses because you just love the feeling of driving. You\u2019re in luck. Biodiesel made out pretty well, too! The bill extended a $1 per gallon tax credit through 2022. And thank God it did, because yes, burning biodiesel produces carbon emissions similar to those of regular fossil fuels, and yes, producing it comes with great costs to air, water, and land. But consider: entering climate hell is a small price to pay for Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley being really happy.\nThe bill approved Tuesday also provides big tax cuts for super wealthy Americans, and permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The tax cuts for individuals expire in 2026. Middle-class and low-income Americans also saw tax cuts, though they were comparatively modest. This all makes sense when you consider the super rich and corporations are both leaders when it comes to climate change and also that rich people are famously hit first and worst by the impacts of the climate crisis. Right? Seriously, it\u2019s great to have someone finally thinking of the forgotten billionaire class and ensuring they have the financial resources available to protect their beachfront mansions from rising seas.\nThe day before they approved these tax breaks, Congress approved a $738 billion Pentagon budget that includes provisions for the Space Force and U.S.-Mexico border wall on Monday. The military is the world\u2019s single largest institutional emitter of greenhouse gases. I can\u2019t exactly explain why a Space Force or a racist border wall that could do irreparable ecological damage are more important than transitioning off of fossil fuels to avoid reaching a level of global warming that the United Nations says would be \u201cdestructive.\u201d But I\u2019m sure the folks on Capitol Hill have the answer.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-ends-with-a-whimper-1840447614", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/now-australias-bushfires-are-fueling-climate-change-1840411693", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655", "https://gizmodo.com/ban-cars-1737654991", "https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TCS-Report-Biodiesel-Bonanza-April-2019.pdf", "https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-senators-urge-epa-boost-biodiesel-support-jobs", "https://gizmodo.com/trumps-favorite-real-estate-will-get-swallowed-by-the-o-1783192072?_ga=2.177433761.564995384.1576451214-248962609.1559160032", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/groundbreaking-report-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-the-u-s-mi-1835458508", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/trumps-border-wall-could-destroy-an-icon-of-the-america-1838703997", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-report-shows-the-world-needs-to-cut-emissions-78-per-1840046835"]},

The Green New Deal is a comprehensive plan to address the environmental crisis, though it has met resistance from Republicans who insist that climate change doesn\u2019t matter to the future of the nation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a battle of survival of this nation,\u201d Trump said before using a racial slur against Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren in a rambling diatribe.\nThe decade of the 2010s saw the rise of social media and the proliferation of digital tools that\u2026\n\u201cWhen you look at these people talk, with their Green New Deal. But I don\u2019t want to knock it now, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to knock it. I knocked... I knocked the hell out of Pocahontas. I got her down.\u201d\nTrump went on to say that he \u201cnever understood wind\u201d while also claiming that he\u2019s studied windmills more than anybody else.\n[With the Green New Deal] we\u2019ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I\u2019ve studied it better than anybody, I know. It\u2019s very expensive. They\u2019re made in China and Germany mostly\u2014very few made here, almost none. But they\u2019re manufactured tremendous, if you\u2019re into this, tremendous fumes, gases are spewing into the atmosphere.\nTrump is misleading everyone by suggesting that the U.S. doesn\u2019t gain jobs through wind energy, of course. The U.S. produces a lot of wind technology through GE and employs tens of thousands of workers, according to a report issued this past summer for the U.S. Department of Energy. In fact, wind energy technician is one of the fastest growing jobs in the country, second only to solar technician.\nTrump continued on to the rabid crowd on Saturday, ranting about how our world is tiny compared with the universe, though it\u2019s not clear what point he was trying to make.\nYou know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint\u2014fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it\u2019s in China, Germany, it\u2019s going into the air. It\u2019s our air, their air, everything, right?\nAt least the president was right that we\u2019re all living on the same planet. That\u2019s why international agreements are so important. President Trump, as you might recall, pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement for no good reason.\nTrump, who has previously said that windmills cause cancer, went on about how wind turbines kill birds, which is accurate, but needs to be placed in context.\nSo they make these things and then they put them up. And if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters, your house is worth 50 percent of the price. They\u2019re noisy. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go. Take a look. A bird graveyard. Go under a windmill someday. You\u2019ll see more birds than you\u2019ve ever seen ever in your life. \nYou know what kills a lot more birds than wind turbines? Fossil-fuel power plants. Even cars kill more birds every year than wind power. But Trump isn\u2019t calling for a ban on cars.\nTrump continued, complaining that California\u2019s windmills are like murderers who should be put in jail. Or something.\nYou know, in California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It\u2019s true. And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That\u2019s true, by the way. This is, they make you turn it off after you, and yet, if you killed one they put you in jail. That\u2019s okay. But why is it okay for these windmills to destroy the bird population? And that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\nPresident Trump\u2019s hatred of windmills is a personal vendetta that dates back many years and has cost him plenty of money. He\u2019s even been ordered to pay $290,000 in legal fees to the Scottish government after failing to block an offshore wind farm near his golf course in Scotland.\nVideo of the entire speech is available on YouTube and a short clip of the part about windmills is below.\nAll in all, the speech was suitably unhinged for a president who has mostly lost touch with reality. But President Trump has learned that he can say whatever he wants now and his supporters will stick with him. \nOne of the more jarring examples was last week when the magazine Christianity Today came out against Trump\u2019s politics:\nThe impeachment hearings have illuminated the president\u2019s moral deficiencies for all to see. This damages the institution of the presidency, damages the reputation of our country, and damages both the spirit and the future of our people. None of the president\u2019s positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character.\nHow did Trump respond? He called Christianity Today a far left magazine, of course. And his followers are standing by him. We live in a truly unnerving time with a dangerous president at the helm. And there\u2019s not much to do at this point but stand by and hope for the best.", "body_links": ["https://qz.com/748241/regular-guy-donald-trump-eats-kfc-with-a-knife-and-fork-on-his-private-jet/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/aoc-just-dropped-her-green-new-deal-proposal-heres-what-1832427261", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/green-new-deal-voted-down-in-senate-after-some-real-bul-1833582102", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-republicans-upcoming-green-real-deal-sounds-like-gr-1833499733", "https://splinternews.com/republican-senator-terrified-that-aoc-is-coming-to-stea-1832572188?_ga=2.11642161.426513259.1577049583-248962609.1559160032", "https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73908.pdf", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/bye-bye-paris-agreement-1839617211", "https://gizmodo.com/trumps-goons-now-forced-to-say-they-have-no-idea-whethe-1833795153", "https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/21/wind-power-results-bird-deaths-overall/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-organization-ordered-to-pay-290000-after-losing-battle-against-scottish-wind-farm/2019/11/12/3657cdd4-0561-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html", "https://youtu.be/H-VI5NWRl2E", "https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html"]},

Polluting countries blocked human rights protections and accountability measures that smaller developing countries pushed around carbon markets, all but ensuring another major showdown in 2020.\nCarbon markets are at the center of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the non-binding international climate resolution that leaders were supposed to strengthen their emissions targets in order to meet (they didn\u2019t do that this year either). The idea behind the article is that countries can trade carbon emissions. In essence, it allows countries with large carbon footprints to offset part of their emissions by paying for other countries\u2019 carbon-saving projects like renewable energy, reforestation, or sustainable agriculture. \nFossil fuel-based industries and their representatives love this approach because it\u2019s expected to become increasingly lucrative and doesn\u2019t require phasing out fossil fuels. But there\u2019s little evidence that carbon markets actually cut emissions, and in the past, they\u2019ve facilitated widespread displacement and other environmental injustices. \nThe longest global climate conference in its 25-year history came to an end Sunday after\u2026\n\u201cCarbon markets are not the solution... but they\u2019re in the Paris Agreement\u201d Jesse Bragg, media director for Corporate Accountability, told Earther. \u201cSo if they\u2019re going to happen, we need to make sure that the rules in place around them protect people and make sure they actually achieve their vision to cut emissions.\u201d\nThe discussion around carbon markets showed the deep divides that exist globally. On one side, 31 countries led by Costa Rica pushed for making sure any market mechanisms had strong human rights and accounting components. On the other, Brazil, Australia, and others pushed for a weaker agreement around markets that would allow carrying over old carbon market credits and double counting. Negotiators also removed language from drafts that would require signatories to \u201crespect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights.\u201d\nIn the end, countries couldn\u2019t reach an agreement leaving a sense of frustration. But the way things ended might be for the better.\n\u201cWhat was on the table was going to do more harm than good,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cWe were still getting these proposals that didn\u2019t have the right protections and safeguards in place.\u201d\nNegotiators now have yet another chance to get things right at a June climate conference in Bonn, Germany and at COP26 in the UK later in 2020. In addition to working on market mechanisms, Bragg suggested that countries should also use those talks put more focus on non-market based solutions like actually cutting emissions. Article 6 includes a toehold for those discussions with a subsection that focuses on non-market approaches to emissions reduction. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the only one that isn\u2019t just putting blind faith in the invisible hand and instead is trying to figure out... how science and policymaking actually guide our reaction to [the climate crisis],\u201d Bragg said. \u201cThat\u2019s key, for governments to put more time into this next time and figure out how to make it operational in the world.\u201d\nA good step to refocusing efforts on non-market solutions is removing fossil fuel interests from the equation. The fossil fuel industry was all over COP25. Polluters sponsored it, plastered it with their logos, and brought dozens of representatives to hold dozens of side events to promote their carbon market proposals. And it\u2019s hardly the only time international climate talks have been overrun by the very companies responsible for the problem they\u2019re supposed to be solving. But there are also more insidious ways fossil fuel interests find their way into negotiations. \n\u201cThere are a handful of consultants that sit on government delegations that have ties to industry groups,\u201d said Bragg. \u201cSo it becomes very hard to determine... are they negotiating on behalf of the country whose delegation they\u2019re on? Or are they doing it on behalf of the trade association or the fossil fuel corporation they have ties to?\u201d\nReal climate action would entail banning fossil fuels. But if we can\u2019t do that, the least we can do is ban fossil fuel representatives from climate negotiations and hosting side events at them.\nIf who\u2019s in the room has to change, so does who\u2019s not in it.\u00a0The Alliance of Small Island States was reportedly excluded from some COP25 negotiations on carbon markets. The alliance includes countries like the Marshall Islands, which health officials said flooding turned into a \u201cwar zone\u201d this month, Bahamas and Haiti, where Hurricane Dorian killed dozens (and possibly thousands) of people this past fall, and Dominica, where Hurricane Maria destroyed an estimated 90 percent of buildings\u2014including the prime minister\u2019s home\u2014last year. These countries have also contributed the least to climate change despite suffering some of the most serious consequences. Without serious action, these nations could get entirely wiped out by extreme weather and sea level rise. \nAnd carbon markets aren\u2019t serious action, because there\u2019s little evidence that they do much to reduce emissions. When the EU created a carbon market in 2005, they doled out so many free credits to polluters that they drove down the price of carbon and failed to make a dent in emissions. The global carbon market developed under the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism in 1997 funneled billions of dollars into projects that failed to reduce emissions 85 percent of the time. \nIf we don\u2019t rapidly cut emissions, we could be headed for 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming above preindustrial levels, which the United Nations says would be \u201cdestructive.\u201d That\u2019s particularly true for countries like the low-lying Marshall Islands\u2014their continued existence relies hinges on the world getting its act together to limit global warming. Those with the most to lose should have a bigger role in negotiations about the role markets can play than countries with vested interests like oil, gas, and agribusiness that want market mechanisms in place to preserve their bottom line.\n\u201cMany countries... are sick and tired of the bullying coming from global north governments,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cBecause for many places, it\u2019s no longer, can we wait a year? It\u2019s no longer possible to wait.\u201d", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-continues-spinning-its-wheels-into-th-1840436426", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-ends-with-a-whimper-1840447614", "https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-q-and-a-how-article-6-carbon-markets-could-make-or-break-the-paris-agreement", "https://www.ncs.ieta.org/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/a-fight-over-a-false-solution-is-at-the-center-of-madri-1840311268", "https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2018/05/24/learning-from-barro-blanco-how-to-improve-stakeholder-consultations-in-climate-projects/", "https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/california-cap-and-trade-environmental-injustice", "https://www.corporateaccountability.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Article-6.8-of-the-Paris-Agreement-A-Non-Market-Approach-to-1_5_v4_FINAL.pdf", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/spains-biggest-polluter-is-sponsoring-the-latest-un-cli-1840153678", "https://twitter.com/pascoesabido/status/1201485514920124416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1201485514920124416&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fearther.gizmodo.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1201485514920124416%26autosize%3D1", "https://www.ncs.ieta.org/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/poland-literally-filled-an-international-climate-change-1830820392", "https://twitter.com/aosischair/status/1205950595745619969?s=21", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/two-months-after-hurricane-dorian-debris-poses-critical-health-risks-n1078531", "https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/docs/0005/registered/9825553393-31_friends_of_the_earth_europe_en.pdf", "https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/85-offsets-failed-reduce-emissions-says-eu-study", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-report-shows-the-world-needs-to-cut-emissions-78-per-1840046835"]},

Environmentalists and landowners whose backyard this monstrosity would run through were pumped. \nUnfortunately, the current president decided to revive Keystone XL within his first month in the White House through executive order. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris\u2014the same one ruling here\u2014reversed that in November 2018, but that didn\u2019t stop Donald Trump who issued a new presidential permit in April.\nEnvironmental groups such as the Indigenous Environmental Network, sued the administration arguing the new permit was illegal, but the president\u2019s people filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit altogether. The courts denied that Friday, adding the whirlwind that\u2019s surrounded the pipeline for a decade. \nWhen Donald Trump took over the White House in 2017, one of his first acts was helping fast track\u2026\n\u201c[T]his is a complete win for the tribes on the motions to dismiss,\u201d Native American Rights Fund attorney Natalie Landreth said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to holding the Trump Administration and TransCanada accountable to the Tribes and the applicable laws that must be followed.\u201d\nIndeed, Judge Morris is clear plaintiffs have a case. He notes that they have offered enough proof that the president may have broken the law by issuing this permit earlier this year. He writes in his order:\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the President lacks the inherent constitutional authority to issue the 2019 Permit, combined with Congress\u2019s approval of the 2004 Executive Order\u2019s permitting process through the [Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act], sufficiently supports Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the 2019 Permit violated the 2004 Executive Order at this stage in the litigation.\u201d\nMany environmental activists, especially indigenous leaders who\u2019ve been at the forefront of fighting the pipeline, are celebrating this ruling as a victory. That being said, the ruling isn\u2019t entirely a win.\nThe plaintiffs were denied their request for a temporary injunction, which would have stopped all work on the pipeline project during the judicial review process. Though there\u2019s currently no ongoing work, pipeline developer TC Energy (formerly known as TransCanada) plans to begin pre-construction work come spring 2020. That work will include transporting pipes and establishing worker camps, which present their own dangers to local communities but especially to indigenous women. \nWhile the judge acknowledged there\u2019s case here, his order said he can\u2019t stop anything that isn\u2019t yet happening. In short, plaintiffs must renew their request once activity actually begins. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but opponents were hoping to stop any of it from even starting during this litigation in the first place. This ruling allows pre-construction to start and continue while opponents wait for a response from the courts after they file. \n\u201cThat is a scenario that could definitely play out, and it is concerning for us,\u201d Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network, told Earther.\nOn the flip side, however, Goldtooth said this might be a good thing. A temporary injunction could\u2019ve potentially given TC Energy a better case for an appeal. It\u2019s tough to know for sure how that appeal would\u2019ve shaken out, but Goldtooth and other groups are still celebrating this ruling. And they\u2019re also preparing for what\u2019s to come. Attempts to stop the pipeline have only grown in intensity after Keystone XL\u2019s forebearer\u2014the Keystone Pipeline\u2014suffered a major spill in November.\n\u201cWe are continuing to prepare for as many scenarios as possible,\u201d Goldtooth said. \u201cWe stand strong with local communities who are defending the sacredness of their land, air, water, and communities. Should construction begin, we want to support communities to defend the sacred.\u201d\nThat means, in part, preparing for an increased police presence, especially in the state of South Dakota where Governor Kristi Noem is planning a second round of riot-boosting laws after the courts ruled against her first batch. \n\u201cThese riot-boosting laws, their intention is clear as day for everybody,\u201d Goldtooth said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the governor is targeting Native communities. It\u2019s obvious that the governor does not want Native peoples to stand up and assert their first amendment right and protect their communities. Everyone I talk to, it\u2019s clear as day that these are racist laws, and they have to be challenged and rejected.\u201d\nThe fight against this pipeline is going to really rev up come 2020.  Construction will begin this coming year. That much is clear. The question is: What happens after the pipes reach the construction site?", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-s-unprecedented-plan-to-restart-the-keystone-xl-1833723790", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591564-KXL-Court-Order.html", "https://io9.gizmodo.com/1687831123#!", "https://gizmodo.com/trumps-pipeline-orders-trample-years-of-environmental-p-1791570112", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/judge-reverses-trump-approval-of-keystone-xl-pipeline-f-1830334122#_ga=2.85794265.1556161580.1554143263-852401423.1546292596", "https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6591564-KXL-Court-Order.html", "https://newrepublic.com/article/155367/connection-pipelines-sexual-violence", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-keystone-pipeline-is-running-again-two-weeks-after-1839783691", "https://apnews.com/42f4533aac4913f2bb686d8d06c14b7b", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/south-dakota-governor-introduces-laws-to-kill-keystone-1833062437?_ga=2.21655219.96417053.1577110705-1498397973.1559224761"]},

It includes the necessary features of any Green New Deal\u2014investment in clean energy jobs, unions, decarbonization of the economy\u2014but also highlights investments in housing, water infrastructure, and new loan programs. Equity and justice rest at the heart of it all. Warren wants everyone to be a part of the revolution to combat climate change, and that\u2019s gonna be what it takes to avert a real crisis and make the world a better place at the same damn time.\nWarren\u2019s proposal calls for a $10.7 trillion investment from the public and private sector that would create 10.6 million new jobs, including 6.8 million in the energy sector alone. This is the first presidential climate plan to seriously go toe to toe with Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 $16 trillion proposal, which says it would create a whopping 20 million jobs. It\u2019s no wonder Warren is edging really close to Sanders on Greenpeace\u2019s scorecard. \nSenator Elizabeth Warren envisions a future where our cars don\u2019t run on gas but on the algae\u2026\nThe Green New Deal that Warren is proposing shows the way her plans all interlock (and indeed how climate change will affect every aspect of American life). In addition to her labor plan, her proposal for a Green New Deal touches on her Blue New Deal, green manufacturing, clean energy, education, and military plans as well. In essence, her latest proposal shows how she would reshape American society over the next decade.\nWarren\u2019s plan leans into the idea that the jobs creating our clean energy future should be fair, high-paying jobs. She calls for \u201cworking hand-in-hand with unions to do so,\u201d and highlights her labor policy that would expand who could be a union member to include supervisors at construction sites who are sometimes left out due to current regulations. She\u2019ll place new requirements on companies that want federal contracts to ensure women and people of color can find employment with them as well, a move that would ensure that everyone has a chance to be part of the transformation needed to address the climate crisis. \nAnd then there\u2019s transportation. The days of gas-guzzling cars must end, so the senator proposes all light- and medium-duty vehicles sold by 2030 be zero-emission. By the end of her first term, every single rest stop in the U.S. will have a charging station. And this electrification will include public buses, school buses, and trains. The Department of Transportation will be plenty busy if Warren winds up president.\nWe all expect a Green New Deal to discuss renewable energy jobs and reducing carbon emissions. What stands out about this policy, however, is its attention to how this investment in the labor sector can help tackle the other crises the U.S. faces. Water issues are worsening across the U.S. as decrepit pipes and stresses of climate change on water supplies take their toll. Warren wants to build a workforce to rip out our aging pipes and prepare dams and levees for an unpredictable future full of storms and floods. \nBeyond how we work and get around, Warren\u2019s plan also includes a call for changing how we live. Specifically, the plan would address the housing crisis in the U.S., particularly the failures of the public housing system. Warren has already signed onto the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act (which Sanders introduced), and she imagines her Green New Deal working in line with this act, which seeks to invest heavily in public housing. The people who live here may not be wealthy or ballers, but they deserve a healthy living standard, especially as climate change makes their homes even more vulnerable. \nThe senator worked closely with Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, to crunch the numbers in her Green New Deal using modeling and federal data to see just how Warren\u2019s plan would change the U.S. economy. Data For Progress senior fellow Kira McDonald worked on the plan and said that there\u2019s potential for job creations numbers to be even higher.\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for more dramatic change,\u201d she told Earther.\nCandidates have been going hard for the climate crisis this election season, and if we can get a Democrat (really, any Democrat this point\u00a0please) into the White House, the planet and those of us that call it home may have a fighting chance. The Green New Deal gives us a chance to not merely survive but  thrive.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re facing a crisis of social continuity, both politically and environmentally,\u201d McDonald said, \u201cand I think the Green New Deal\u2014by building a coalition, by rebuilding family-sustaining jobs as a reasonable expectation for people in the workforce, and by addressing climate change\u2014really addresses these crises in a unified and strategic way.\u201d ", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/elizabeth-warren-proposes-a-green-new-deal-for-the-ocea-1840336206", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/aoc-just-dropped-her-green-new-deal-proposal-heres-what-1832427261", "https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/green-jobs?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-rollout-20191220", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/bernie-sanders-climate-plan-is-nothing-short-of-a-revol-1837456120", "https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/climate2020/", "https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/empowering-american-workers", "https://gizmodo.com/ban-cars-1737654991", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/newarks-lead-tainted-water-crisis-is-getting-worse-1837247671", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/climate-change-threatens-water-resources-for-nearly-2-b-1840320207", "https://gizmodo.com/dramatic-satellite-images-show-the-oroville-dam-from-dr-1792474219?_ga=2.229934110.388909567.1576762146-248962609.1559160032", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/aoc-and-bernies-green-new-deal-aims-to-change-our-relat-1839859924", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-energy-upside-to-ilhan-omars-trillion-dollar-public-1840039751", "https://www.dataforprogress.org/warren-green-jobs-plan", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/an-hbcu-is-hosting-the-first-presidential-forum-on-envi-1839702558", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/jay-inslees-long-green-shadow-over-the-2020-race-1837851144", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/reversing-trumps-pipeline-approvals-is-the-latest-litmu-1837412800", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/elizabeth-warrens-latest-climate-plan-is-a-2-trillion-1835244827", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/giant-space-mirrors-engineered-glaciers-presidential-1833669977", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/billionaire-buys-climate-change-on-google-1840051709"]},

Researchers are warning in a new paper that the very greenhouse gas that\u2019s driving most of our global warming\u2014yes, carbon dioxide\u2014is also diminishing indoor air quality. And it may be messing with our ability to make decisions and think strategically.\nThe research was presented at this year\u2019s annual American Geophysical Union fall meeting and submitted to the journal GeoHealth for peer review. The findings focus on students of the future. Today\u2019s students already face obstacles due to the increased risk of classroom heat in a warmer world. It turns out rising carbon dioxide could only make things worse.\nPrevious research has looked at the impact of indoor air pollution and carbon dioxide levels on test scores. Carbon dioxide levels tend to build up in confined spaces (especially ones with poor ventilation) because we all exhale it. Improving ventilation solves that by bringing in more air from outside, and research shows that reducing levels could improve math scores. But in a world ravaged by extreme carbon emissions, improving ventilation might actually make the situation worse.\nCleaner air can go a long way in saving lives, according to a new report out Friday. It found that\u2026\nThat led the researchers on the new study to develop a model to see what the future might hold. That model includes the typical number of students in a classroom, the size of a classroom, the usual ventilation rates, and the impact each has on cognitive functioning. The paper then ran that model under at least two commonly used climate scenarios, including one where the world cuts carbon emissions start in mid-century and another where they continue to rise dramatically. \nThe findings show that basic decision-making ability in people in a classroom setting could decrease by about 25 percent by 2100 due to increased carbon dioxide in the worst-case scenario. Students\u2019 complex strategic thinking abilities may drop by some 50 percent by the end of the century if carbon emissions continue to increase under the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario. The youth are the future, and one with a bunch of kids struggling to get an education doesn\u2019t sound like a great one. Shelly Miller, a co-author and professor of environmental engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder, told Earther that it also raises questions about how ventilation should be designed in the future to ensure it\u2019s not doing more harm than good.\nWhile a future of continually rising emissions sounds terrible, the study also found, however, that \u201cthese results are almost entirely avoidable by reducing global CO2 emissions.\u201d\u00a0\nResearchers used to see carbon dioxide as a sign of poor ventilation but never as the culprit of reduced health impacts, Joel Kaufman, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Washington, said in an email to Earther. Instead, they focused on the impact of volatile organic compounds and other signs of indoor air pollution. But research is beginning to show carbon dioxide may actually be a part of the problem. \nGeneral air pollution has been linked to decreased brain function. Research looking at the impact of carbon dioxide on learning specifically dates back to at least 1967, but it\u2019s only taken off in the last few years as it\u2019s become increasingly clear how much carbon dioxide exposure may rise if world leaders fail to act on the climate crisis.\nThere have been experiments in controlled settings where researchers have adjusted ventilation rates in rooms or straight up had participants breathe in carbon dioxide-enriched air. A 2011 paper where participants inhaled carbon dioxide through a face mask found that their anxiety levels increased afterward. In 2016, Harvard researchers elevated carbon dioxide levels as well as volatile organic compounds in environmentally controlled office spaces to see the impact on participants\u2019 focus levels and crisis response. They found each had \u201csignificant, independent impacts\u201d on cognitive function.\n \u201cIt is concerning, and yet it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s the mechanism,\u201d Miller said.\nFiguring out this mechanism is key. Some research has found that even a 5 percent increase in carbon dioxide reduces oxygen and brain activity. Still, the body of research includes some inconsistent findings, William Fisk, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\u2019s Indoor Environment Group, wrote in an email to Earther. And the research has yet to look at the impacts of long-term exposure, which is the future we all potentially face.\nWhat researchers do know is this: Humans have never experienced the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide this high, let alone if the worst-case scenario comes to fruition. We already know so much about the risks carbon pollution poses to the climate. But we still have so much learn about how it could affect other things, and that\u2019s in part why Miller looked more closely at the potential impact on cognitive functioning. And it only adds to the growing list of reasons for why climate change requires urgent action.\n\u201cI want to try to gather these important facts and associations in science to say, \u2018There\u2019s a lot happening here, and you should care, and maybe you\u2019ll care more if you know this,\u2019\u201d she said.", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-do-heat-waves-make-ozone-pollution-so-much-worse-1827319433", "https://eartharxiv.org/b8umq/", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/climate-change-could-set-kids-up-to-fail-1826637932", "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136165", "https://gizmodo.com/air-pollution-gets-into-your-brain-and-scientists-want-1836977623?_ga=2.235520705.1949011780.1576502829-1498397973.1559224761", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0013469467900235", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/beer-rich-people-and-racing-horses-all-made-out-bette-1840507222", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/how-to-fix-the-biggest-issue-plaguing-un-climate-talks-1840480211", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-ends-with-a-whimper-1840447614", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138667/", "https://green.harvard.edu/tools-resources/research-highlight/impact-green-buildings-cognitive-function", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20842164"]},

Going through these images can be laborious and time-consuming, but a new program\u2014a partnership between Google and several conservation organizations\u2014simplifies the process with the help of artificial intelligence.\nWildlife Insights, an online portal with more than 4.5 million photos dating back to 1990, launched Tuesday. Anyone, anywhere can access the photos and pinpoint the location of wildlife. And the site also invites collaborators to drop their own camera trap images to map creatures around the world and grow the database.\nThere has never been a period like this in the history of humanity. In a sweeping report delivered\u2026\nThe database creates a one-stop shop for wildlife camera trap data, which is cool in its own right. But researchers could analyze this data before Google\u2019s help. Sorting through anywhere from 300 to 1,000 images could take up to an hour, though. The real benefit of Wildlife Insights is the machine learning aspect, which can  analyze 3.6 million photos an hour. That saves researchers precious time from boring-ass tasks like inputting data into a spreadsheet. \nAll they have to do now is upload a set of images and let the Google-created artificial intelligence system do the rest, including flag blank images that sometimes make up most of the camera trap data. The only main data point conservationists may have to add are the GPS coordinates for specific camera traps as most of these cameras aren\u2019t yet fitted with their own GPS system, Jorge Ahumada, executive director of Wildlife Insights from Conservation International, told Earther.\nFreed of the tedium of data entry, conservation scientists now have more time and resources to easily analyze it to discover trends in species population size, predator-prey relationships, and how animals may be responding to human disturbances such as hunting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very intimate look into the behavior and the ecology of these animals that you would not get unless you spend hours and hours and hours hiding in the forest with a camera, which most people cannot do and is very expensive,\u201d Ahumada told Earther.\nWhat\u2019s more, the new program goes as far as to identify species in these photos. That was another datapoint researchers had to previously input manually, but the program is now trained to accurately identify about 100 species, Ahumada said. The team\u2014which includes Conservation International, Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, World Wildlife Fund, and Zoological Society of London, among others\u2014\u2028accomplished this by inputting about 8.4 million images into the program initially to help train the artificial intelligence to recognize different animals. \nThe goal is that with each new photo added, the software will become more sophisticated. For instance, Wildlife Insights currently lacks data on Australian wildlife. Once camera trap data from that region enters the program, the team will first manually identify animals, training the AI to recognize species the next time. \nThis matters because the\u00a0extinction\u00a0crisis\u00a0is\u00a0real. A million species face potential extinction in the coming decades. Climate change exacerbates other human threats to wildlife habitat and ecosystems (speaking of, maybe Google should listen to its employees and stop funding climate denial). The new data and AI technology are among a suite of useful tools for creating conservation measures that can help lower the pressure on animals just trying to survive.\nSo far, the program remains in beta mode. Any random user can\u2019t go ahead and upload photos, but that\u2019s the ultimate goal once the website can support hundreds of users uploading photos at once. Browsing through the animals already identified on the database\u2014wild boars in Malaysia\u2019s Pasoh Forest Reserve or ocelots in Guatemala\u2019s Parque Nacional Laguna del Tigre\u2014showcases the wide array of wildlife that exists on our planet.

The precedent-setting case provides a huge bump to other court battles happening around the world with citizens\u2019 making similar arguments about government inaction.\nThe case filed by Urgenda, a Dutch foundation focused on sustainability, has been wending its way through courts since 2015. The Dutch government has fought it despite the clear and present dangers sea level rise poses to one of the lowest-lying countries on Earth. But with Friday\u2019s victory, the government now has a little bit of catch up to do, with the ruling calling for the Netherlands to reduce its carbon emissions at a minimum of 25 percent below 1990 levels by the end of next year.\nTo my surprise, this year from hell has actually gifted the climate movement with some celebratory\u2026\n\u201cIt was a bit of an emotional moment,\u201d Dennis van Berkel, a lawyer with Urgenda, told Earther. \u201cWe knew how important this was. We did everything we could to get to this outcome and then to hear the judge make such strong statements and thinking about the impacts of those statements. This judgment gives hope that there is something you can do to force the actions that we need [to address climate change].\u201d\nThe ruling is one of the most radical victories not just of the year but the past decade, one that has seen governments fail to act on climate change as emissions skyrocket and the signs of climate catastrophe become ever clearer. A handful of high-profile legal cases in the U.S. have so far failed, but the Netherlands victory has the potential to radically reshape the climate law landscape. \nThe cases that have failed so far have been focused on material damages. But the Dutch case was focused on human rights. Urgenda argued that carbon pollution was infringing on Dutch citizens\u2019 rights to life enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, a treaty signed by 47 countries. The Dutch Supreme Court agreed, noting that the treaty\u00a0\u201crequires states that are members of the Convention to ensure for their residents the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention.\u201d \nWith this ruling, the 46 other signatory countries have essentially been put on watch. Other groups could take this ruling and bring it to bear in courtrooms across Europe and beyond, from Russia to the UK. That\u2019s where the real power in this ruling lies. The Netherlands accounts for a little less than half a percent of the world\u2019s emissions. But signatories to the convention account for more than 15 percent of the world\u2019s emissions. \nvan Berkel said that numerous countries also have human rights obligations enshrined in treaties and constitutions (\u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d anyone?). That opens the door to still more legal challenges around the world and more emissions reductions. And then there\u2019s international law like the United Nations Rights of the Child, which is at the center of a landmark complaint filed earlier this year by Greta Thunberg and 15 other children.\nThat means this ruling could exact real movement on the climate crisis in a way that international talks and other forms of cajoling have so far failed to do. And the timeline Urgenda asked for and with which the judge\u2019s agreed (and what science demands to avert catastrophic global heating) shows just how rapidly countries could be compelled to get down to business. To that end, van Berkel said the a group of 750 organizations in the Netherlands have put forward a list of 50 measures the government could undertake to draw down emissions over the next year, and that they\u2019re \u201cprepared to help implement this.\u201d\nThis case may well unleash others like it around the world, but\u00a0van Berkel said he hopes there isn\u2019t a wave of lawsuits because that would mean governments are still failing to take the climate crisis and the human rights violations that go with it seriously. Instead, this case is almost like a sword of Damocles hanging over governments.\n\u201cWhat we really need is governments to take their own responsibility,\u201d van Berkel said.. \u201cThis is one part in the bigger toolset we as citizens now have to ask this of the governments. Hopefully the biggest impact of this case is not how it might inspire other courts. What we hope is that governments get going.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be fighting our governments. We want to be working our governments.\u201d", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-environmental-wins-of-2019-1840349301", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/in-world-first-a-court-has-reaffirmed-a-governments-re-1829626079", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/exxon-escapes-1840341873", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/judge-hands-oil-companies-a-win-in-high-profile-climate-1827131862", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/its-kids-vs-the-world-in-a-landmark-new-climate-lawsui-1838343565", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-chiarra-sacchi-filed-a-landmark-climate-complaint-a-1838486838", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-teen-climate-activist-alexandria-villasenor-is-suin-1838370232", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-climate-summit-ends-with-a-whimper-1840447614", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748"]},

That series, Extreme E, now has an official calendar, and plans to kick off in January 2021.\nThe Extreme E off-road series will also have its home base on the water, with  former Royal Mail Ship RMS St. Helena used as its \u201cfloating paddock\u201d throughout the championship. It\u2019ll be unique, if anything.\nExtreme E announced its inaugural 2021 calendar on Tuesday, saying it\u2019ll visit five different locations that year on four continents. The season will start in Senegal at the end of January and end in Brazil in October, and Extreme E said its goal is to work with local officials and experts to \u201ccombat issues such as deforestation, rising sea levels, melting glacier ice, desertification, and plastic pollution.\u201d The admirable goal of the series, at least as it advertises, is to show the impact of humans and climate change in remote locations while promoting the adoption of electric vehicles.\nSure, the car races themselves in these locations aren\u2019t actively fighting climate change and other human-made pollutants, but it\u2019s cool that the series wants to help with those things in conjunction with its races.\nThe provisional 2021 calendar, via Extreme E, is: \n22-23-24 January: Lac Rose, Dakar, Senegal\n4-5-6 March: Sharaan, Al-\u2018Ula, Saudi Arabia\n6-7-8 May: Kali Gandaki Valley, Mustang District, Nepal\n27-28-29 August: Kangerlussuaq, Greenland\n29-30-31 October: Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, Brazil\nEach of those locations, the announcement said, represents a different type of terrain being affected by climate change and other human activity: the ocean leg, Senegal; the desert in Saudi Arabia; the mountain round in \u201cthe heart of the Himalayas\u201d in Nepal; a glacier round in Greenland; and the rainforest round in Brazil. The announcement also made sure to mention that organizers will have assessments done at each location in order to make a priority of \u201cenvironmental protection, social inclusivity and fair political practices.\u201d\nAnnouncements on further drivers, partnerships and teams, Extreme E said, will come soon.\nAlejandro Agag, the founder of the young but newly FIA-recognized Formula E World Championship, is also behind Extreme E, and said in the announcement that the series will be especially good for \u201canyone that denies [the] existence [of climate change] or is unaware of the problems it is causing.\u201d\nWhile an electric SUV series might not sound like the greatest thing in the world at first, Extreme E is making itself out to be something so unimaginable in the real world that it almost seems like it\u2019s out of a video game. Its plan, at least, is to visit the types of locations we\u2019d watch regular environmental documentaries on because it\u2019s either too expensive or too much effort to visit them ourselves, but also add race cars in the mix while claiming to help local authorities with the environmental issues they\u2019re facing. \nWhether all of that pans out, who knows. But a series that claims to care enough about the environments it races in to help those places, rather than visiting and leaving right after the race is over, is a noble concept. Plus, watching car races combined with environmental documentaries sounds fun as hell. It\u2019s like movie day in science class, with the addition of race cars. \nWe\u2019ll just have to wait until 2021 to find out if Extreme E ends up being as noble as it sounds.

(The EPA actually estimates using approved water- and electricity-conserving fixtures and appliances can save the average household $350 annually, a figure that presumably accounts for the occasional courtesy flush.) \nTrump, as he became only the third president in 243 years of U.S. history to face impeachment, rambled again about bathroom difficulties to his audience in Battle Creek\u2014making sure this time to note that it is not him, of course, who needs to flush the toilet a dozen times to dispose of his leavings, but many others.\nTranscript below the videos: \nSinks, uh, showers, all of this stuff, I did a lot of it. No water comes out. You have areas where there\u2019s so much water you don\u2019t know what to do with it. You turn on the shower, you\u2019re not allowed to have any water anymore. I mean, we do a lot of it. Uh, dishwashers. You did the dishwasher, right? You press it. Remember the dishwasher, you press it? Boom, there\u2019d be like an explosion, five minutes later, you open it, the steam pours out, the dishes. Now you press it 12 times. Women tell me. Again. You know, they give you four drops of water. And they\u2019re in places where there\u2019s so much water they don\u2019t know what to do with it. So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers. We\u2019re going back to you.\n... Now we\u2019re doing it with a lot of other things. Uh, dishwashers, and uh, you know. I won\u2019t tell you one of the things because every time I tell you they do a big number on it. You know the one I\u2019m talking about, right? Sinks, right? Showers? And what goes with a sink and a shower?\n[Crowd chants, \u201cA toilet!\u201d]\nTen times, right? Ten times. [Trump does flushing motion while saying something that sounds like \u2018bah, bop.\u2019] Not me of course, not me, but you. You. But I never mention that. Because one time I mentioned all three. I said, sinks, showers, and toilets. The headline was, \u2018Trump with the toilets, toilets.\u2019 That\u2019s all they want. They don\u2019t even mention the, so I didn\u2019t mention that, okay? I go off the record.\nBut you know what, it\u2019s terrible. You wanna wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out. So you leave the water, go ten times as long, it\u2019s same thing. You have a shower. Drip. It\u2019s no good for me, for me.\nYou know, the one thing that came out really good about being in this business, they used to say I wore a hairpiece...\nTo reiterate: The president spent part of the night he was impeached telling a rally in Michigan that it is not him who poops too much for it to go down in a single flush, but \u201cyou\u201d who poops too much for it to go down in a single flush.\nAt other points during the rally, according to a excerpts posted to Twitter by Media Matters\u2019 Parker Malloy and Vox journalist Aaron Rupar, he rambled about how enemy forces \u201ccan\u2019t see\u201d stealth fighters, rattled off a make-believe conversation between Bill and Hillary Clinton, said he could still lock up Hillary Clinton, called Representative Adam Schiff unattractive, touted nonexistent plans for the \u201cgreatest health care ever\u201d while bragging about the rollback of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, and suggested that late Representative John Dingell is in hell.\nCorrection: On second reference, we referred to Battle Creek as in Wisconsin.

Partnering with a local nonprofit, NC GreenPower, they used that money to install solar panels and provide curricula about them to 10 North Carolina schools.\nIf you just skimmed Duke\u2019s press release, you\u2019d be forgiven for missing the important context at the bottom. The investment was part of a $5.4 million 2015 settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental organizations over alleged Clean Air Act violations. And you wouldn\u2019t find any mention of Duke having near total control over NC GreenPower\u2019s board nor how Duke fought to restrict the solar industry the previous year while trying to expand its pipeline infrastructure. But it got great press!\nA new first-of-its-kind report shows that this isn\u2019t a unique case. The Energy and Policy Institute looked into 10 of the top investor-owned utility companies in the U.S. and found that every single one \u201cuse[s] their charitable giving to manipulate politics, policies and regulations in ways designed to increase shareholder profits, often at the expense of low-income communities.\u201d\nThe companies gave over $1 billion dollars to charitable organizations from 2013 to 2017. That\u2019s 13 times the amount of money the utility sector as a whole, including political action committees and even individual employees, gave to federal elections over the last three elections, the report notes. And unlike those donations, charitable ones don\u2019t have to be disclosed. \nSometimes, companies directly funded organizations that later supported them on an issue via testimony or public comment, like when American Electric Power donated to Ohio\u2019s United Way chapter and Columbus\u2019 YWCA in 2014. Following those donations, both groups lauded a company plan that included subsidies for coal plants. \nOther times, utilities invested in organizations affiliated with policymakers, like when Arizona Public Service kicked thousands of dollars in donations to charitable groups that state Senator Robert Meza worked for. He personally profited from some of that funding and then turned around and became one of the only Democrats to oppose a state renewable portfolio standard in 2018. Despite the obvious conflict, he said his position had nothing to do with the thousands of dollars he made from Arizona Public Service donations.\nFrequently, the report notes, utility companies use charity to gain support from environmental justice groups and other organizations representing low-income communities and communities of color. One example it highlights is earlier this year when Michigan\u2019s DTE Energy faced staunch opposition to a plan that would charge residents for using rooftop solar power. But then, seemingly out of nowhere, a group called Michigan Energy Promise, made up of churches and racial justice organizations, popped on the scene and came out in favor of the plan. Many members of the group had one thing in common: They had recently received thousands of dollars from DTE\u2019s foundation, listed DTE as a corporate sponsor, or had DTE executives on their boards.\nThe report can\u2019t prove that the utility companies did all of this on purpose, but the pattern sure looks damning. \u201cEven if a small portion of the $1 billion that only these 10 utilities gave to charity was politically motivated\u2014a proposition which seems likely based on the case studies documented here\u2014then utilities\u2019 influence-seeking via charity would be at least as large, if not much larger than, their other forms of political spending such as traditional campaign contributions.\u201d \nThe Energy and Policy Institute proposes a solution: force utilities to disclose their charitable contributions so it\u2019s clearer where influence could be coming from.\nUpdate 12/18/19 1:50 p.m.: This post has been updated to note that the report looked at 10 of the top investor-owned utilities, not the top 10.

This record-breaking heat doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, though.

Southern Australia will especially feel the heat, but southeastern Australia faces a particularly high risk of feeling the burn as strengthening winds increase the fire danger in the region. People there have to stay on alert for the flames, but they also should keep an eye on the local air quality as smoke may increase air pollution in the coming days. Sydneysiders know that story all too well after choking on the most toxic air on the planet last week.\nIf you want to understand the depths of the climate crisis, Australia is a prime place to look. The country has warmed about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1910, with a sharp spike in temperatures in recent years. The country dealt with a similar dangerous heat wave around this time last year. That led to the country\u2019s hottest month ever recorded. The heat building this time around may just soar past that record, but that\u2019s nothing to celebrate. The bushfires being driven in part by the rising heat are releasing carbon pollution and make climate change worsen ensuring more human and ecological misfortune. \nUpdate 1:35 p.m. ET: It appears Australia\u2019s record was broken yet again Wednesday.

And with record-breaking heat and bushfires getting even larger, it feels like Australia is living in the future. That future, unfortunately, looks a lot like Mad Max.\nPolice in New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, report that a farmer in the small town of Evans Plain had about 80,000 gallons of water (300,000 liters) stolen from his property, according to the Australian newspaper. The farmer only noticed the theft from two enormous storage tanks on Sunday, though it could have happened at anytime between December 9 and December 15, according to authorities.\nIt\u2019s becoming more and more common to see thieves targeting water storage facilities, as climate change continues to devastate Australia as it heads into summer. Just a couple of weeks ago, thieves in the small town of Murwillumbah stole about 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of water, enough to fill about six or seven fire trucks, according to local authorities. \nAnd it all feels like something out of a sci-fi dystopia, where battles over water are fought to sustain a meager existence.\nAustralia is reeling from extreme heat this week, breaking temperature records for the past three days, and reaching an average maximum temperature of 40.9 degrees Celsius (105.6 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, and 40.7 degrees Celsius (105.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re smashing the extremes by effectively a degree relative to the other cases because that\u2019s by how much the Australian temperatures have warmed,\u201d climate scientist David Karoly told the ABC on Friday. \u201cClimate change has contributed between 1C and 1.5C on top of the natural variability.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just the heat. Australia is attempting to get its large bushfires under control, some of which might be the largest wildfires in modern history. The \u201cmegafire\u201d in Gospers Mountain, just outside of Sydney, has burned roughly 7.4 million acres over the past two months and has blanketed the city in smoke.\nAustralia has been left scarred by heat and flames and choked by smoke. Australians are\u2026\nSadly, at least nine people have died from the Australian bushfires this season, with two volunteer firefighters in New South Wales losing their lives this week, and a citizen of South Australia dying in a vehicle crash yesterday while trying to escape a fire.\nMeanwhile, the prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, is missing in action while the country experiences a climate crisis. Morrison\u2019s office has denied rumors that he\u2019s vacationing in Hawaii, but photos on social media prove otherwise. Under Australian law, another politician is appointed as acting prime minister when the real PM is out of the country, and Morrison\u2019s stand-in isn\u2019t doing much better to take climate change seriously.\n\u201cYes, the smoke is a problem but smoke, as it always does, will blow away,\u201d acting PM Michael McCormack told a local TV news station yesterday.\nMorrison issued a statement yesterday apologizing if any Australians were offended by his decision to take a vacation during this time.\n\u201cI deeply regret any offense caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to their families, friends and colleagues who have been working tirelessly beside them, particularly during this Christmas period. Given these most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney from leave as soon as can be arranged,\u201d he continued.\nBut Prime Minister Morrison\u2019s tone was defiant and almost whiney when he spoke to a local radio station via phone from Hawaii.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hold a hose, mate, and I don\u2019t sit in a control room,\u201d Morrison told 2GB radio. \u201cThat\u2019s the brave people who \u2026 are doing that job. But I know that Australians would want me back at this time [\u2026] of these fatalities. So I\u2019ll happily come back and do that.\u201d\nHow generous of you, Mr. Morrison.

No matter the country, you can always count on the police to treat protestors like shit\u2014and that doesn\u2019t exclude children, unfortunately. \nReporter and journalism student River McCrossen captured the moment a police officer told a young girl that she and her father needed to evacuate the premises or \u201cforce may be used.\u201d She was fighting tears and looked distraught during the interaction. Even as she walked away, the child held up her sign in defiance, which read \u201cLook at what you\u2019ve left us, watch us fight it, watch us win.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t arrested, but New South Wales Member of Parliament David Shoebridge was  along with nine others (including a child), per the Australian Associated Press. What\u2019s pissing off a lot of people is not only the prime minister\u2019s absence during this immediate crisis; it\u2019s also his lack of action on the crisis at large that is climate change. \nIn order to prevent these awful heat waves and bush fires from becoming more common, the world needs to dramatically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Australia, however, is set to increase its coal exports at a time when they need to end. Even though the country is seeing more solar panel installations, half of its energy generation comes from coal. \nAustralia was also a major impediment to action at the climate talks that just concluded in Madrid. It pushed for weaken key rules that ultimately led a pretty pathetic outcome. \nMeanwhile, the country continues to cook under a record-setting heat wave and bushfires may rage for months longer. And Aboriginal leaders in central Australia are worried the region could be becoming too hot for humans to survive.\nNone of this is acceptable, and the people won\u2019t stand for it any longer.

The National Weather Service has issued a wind chill advisory for parts of the Hudson River Valley and western Massachusetts and Connecticut where it could feel as cold as minus-25 degrees Fahrenheit.

Methane has up to 25 times the greenhouse gas potential of CO2 over a 100-year period, though it has historically proven difficult to quantify just how much methane is actually spewing from well blowouts, fissures in pipelines, and intentional releases from high-pressure gas valves and pipeline compressors.\nOver the course of 20 days, the researchers found, ExxonMobil subsidiary XTO Energy\u2019s busted-ass well released more methane than all but three European countries do annually. According to the Washington Post and New York Times, the 60 kiloton figure is unsurprisingly five times greater than Exxon\u2019s original assessment of the leak and places the incident as the second-largest U.S. methane leak in history.\n\u201cWe deeply regret this incident occurred and are committed to identifying and managing risks associated with our activities to prevent recurrence,\u201d ExxonMobil spokeswoman Julie L. King told the Post in an email.\n Another company spokesperson, Casey Norton, told the Times their researchers had arrived at the lower estimate via pressure gauges at the well and studying imagery. Norton said the energy giant had \u201cagreed to sit down and talk further to understand the discrepancy and see if there\u2019s anything that we can learn... This was an anomaly. This is not something that happens on any regular basis. And we do our very best to prevent this from ever happening.\u201d\nResearchers were able to focus the European Space Agency\u2019s Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, which had just made it to space on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, on the Ohio blowout on day 13. U.S.-based researcher Steven Hamburg of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), which was working on the satellite program with the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht, told reporters that the study\u2019s primary accomplishment was demonstrating the effectiveness of a new way of locating and measuring methane leaks. The EDF believes that the Environmental Protection Agency is underestimating the gas and oil industry\u2019s methane emissions by 60 percent, according to the Post.\n\u201cMethane emissions are a huge contributor to climate change,\u201d Hamburg told the Post. \u201cBut source locations are often unpredictable and can occur in out-of-the-way places all over the globe. New results show the opportunity for satellites to help see and quantify emissions no matter where they are.\u201d\nHamburg also told the Times that the research demonstrates energy companies don\u2019t have the methane leak problem \u201cunder control\u201d as claimed, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t understand what was actually happening.\u201d He added, \u201cIs this a once a year kind of event? Once a week? Once a day? Knowing that will make a big difference in trying to fully understand what the aggregate emissions are from oil and gas.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d study co-author Ilse Aben told the Times. \u201cWith a single observation, a single overpass, we\u2019re able to see plumes of methane coming from large emission sources. That\u2019s something totally new that we were previously not able to do from space.\u201d ", "body_links": ["http://cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html", "https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/12/10/1908712116", "https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#CH4%20reference", "http://theconversation.com/why-methane-emissions-matter-to-climate-change-5-questions-answered-122684", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/turns-out-our-methane-emissions-are-really-fucking-bad-1827029647", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/a-blowout-turned-an-ohio-gas-well-into-a-methane-super-emitter/2019/12/16/fcbdf622-1f9e-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"]},

Sometimes, you couldn\u2019t even finish reading about one when the next popped up. It was hard to whittle this list down because there were so many environmental rollbacks to choose from.\nOther presidents have\u00a0revoked environmental policies, and it\u2019s not like Trump\u2019s predecessor was perfect. But this shit is on a different level. If he gets voted out next year, it\u2019ll be hard to choose his worst legacy. But I think Trump\u2019s environmental record will be it, in part because his administration has endangered the whole planet. \nAll of Trump\u2019s rollbacks are even worse when considered in aggregate with all the other horrible things the Trump administration did this year. Medicaid work requirements? Awful, and even worse because the climate crisis is worsening public health and costing Americans billions in health bills. Declaring a national emergency to build the border wall? Sadistic and cruel, and as a fun bonus, could cause irreparable ecological damage.\u00a0\nThe following list doesn\u2019t even include all of the rollbacks of 2019. But some good stuff happened this year too, y\u2019all! But if this makes you mad, remember that next year will bring a crucial election and United Nations climate conference. The climate crisis has taken lives we\u2019ll never get back, but we can still make changes to prevent everything from getting much, much worse. \nTrump announced he\u2019d withdraw the US from the world\u2019s main climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, back in June 2017. But he couldn\u2019t actually start the process until November 4 of this year. When he did, he made the U.S. the only country in the world to reject the agreement.\nThe agreement is non-binding and far from sufficient to take on the climate crisis. It won\u2019t be enough to stop sea level rise from destroying coasts and low-lying islands or to prevent an extinction crisis that wipes out thousands of species. In terms of actual emissions reductions needed to avert climate catastrophe, most countries are basically just thumbing their noses at the agreement. And yet, unfortunately, it\u2019s the only international climate policy of its kind. So here\u2019s the verdict: this rollback is very bad. \nThe U.S. can formally leave the agreement on [checks notes] one day after the 2020 election.\nSpeaking of extinction, on August 12, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service announced that they completed their cruel changes to the Endangered Species Act. Those changes will make it much harder for the federal government to protect creatures that are dying off. Some particularly awful provisions they added limit the extent to which the impacts of climate change can be used as a basis to determine if a species should be considered \u201cthreatened.\u201d And climate change threatens all kinds of species.\nThe Trump administration had its sights on wiping out the Clean Power Plan since early 2017. But it put the final nail in the coffin in June despite widespread disapproval. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule replacing it, known as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, is a joke\u2014and a really unfunny one at that. The administration claims they want it to reduce emissions from power plants, but it wants to do so... without regulating them? Research shows their replacement rule could actually result in up to 11 million more tons of carbon dioxide emitted nationally by 2050 compared to no policy at all.\nIt\u2019s also honestly racist. The new rule states that it will \u201cimprove environmental justice communities\u2019 health\u201d (I truly hate the idea of anyone writing policy for the Trump administration disingenuously saying \u201cenvironmental justice communities\u201d), but studies show that it could result in increased emissions of the air pollutants sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in many states. And for the mostly low-income communities of color where fossil fuel infrastructure gets built, that can be deadly.\nThe EPA wasn\u2019t just messing with was power plant pollution rules. The agency as well as the Army Corps of Engineers also rolled back a major rule that defines which U.S. bodies of water are covered by the Clean Water Act known as the Waters of the U.S. (or it\u2019s delightful-sounding acronym WOTUS) rule. That move meant over half of the nation\u2019s wetlands and 18 percent of streams lost their federal protections from pollution. That provides a huge benefit to corporate polluters like Big Ag. Those streams and wetlands flow into the rivers and lakes that provide millions of people with drinking water, which is a big issue for the rest of us.\nDo you like carbon dioxide? Then you\u2019ll love methane, a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent at trapping heat for its first 20 years in the atmosphere. Turns out the Trump administration loves it, too. In August, the EPA announced their plans to remove methane emissions standards from the Clean Air Act.\nOnce this becomes law, the EPA will have no grounds under the act to force power plants and fossil fuel infrastructure to cut their methane emissions. Keep in mind, even freaking Shell wants tighter methane regulations. And it looks like states\u2019 environmental control agencies don\u2019t have the capacity to do that either, because most of them have seen budget cuts. Methane for all!\nCars are the biggest source of carbon emissions in the U.S. California is the biggest economy in the U.S. Letting the state set stricter auto standards would seem like a surefire to help the country as a whole get a handle on carbon pollution. So naturally Trump decided to revoke the state\u2019s ability to do just that.\nBefore doing that, Trump tried to roll back Obama-era federal emissions standards, but even some major automakers didn\u2019t want that. In response to the California rollback, the Golden State and a coalition of other states sued the EPA. Trump asked a federal judge to throw out the case. We\u2019ll see what happens in 2020, but for now, the rollback stands.\nInefficient incandescent light bulbs\u2014which the EPA notes are also more expensive\u2014were going to be phased out of use in the U.S. by 2020. And yet the Trump administration rolled back efficiency standards for lighting that will keep the bulbs around because... they make the president look orange? I don\u2019t even know what to say about this one.\nSometimes I think they\u2019re just doing this to mess with us, you know? Like, I almost want to laugh. But then I remember the stakes.

Yes, even if air pollution is increasing in the U.S. Even if the Amazon Rainforest burned. And even if the ice just won\u2019t stop melting. We gotta look at the bright side, man, even when everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart. Otherwise, how do remain sane enough to keep fighting for a safe and livable planet?\nHere are some of Earther\u2019s top wins of 2019. Here\u2019s to more (and bigger) wins in 2020.\nAfter years as a dream of transitioning off fossil fuels while improving the quality of life for all Americans, the Green New Deal got real this year. Youth activists with the Sunrise Movement elevated the issue throughout the 2018 midterms, and they found allies in the new Congress who were willing to push to decarbonize the economy and not screw people. In February, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced a Green New Deal resolution in the House and long-time climate champion Ed Markey did the same in the Senate. Since then, we\u2019ve seen legislative proposals for a Green New Deal for public housing as well as another housing bill that interlocks with it. On the presidential campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren has proposed a Blue New Deal focused on the oceans.\nAll these pieces of legislation and proposals still have a long way to go before becoming any type of climate policy, but that\u2019s only because many elected officials are scared of change. The Democrats want to take their time, and the Republicans want to make sure the world ends. At least the American public now knows that the Green New Deal is an option. And nearly all Americans want to see it become a reality.\nThis hype around climate change at the political level isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum, though. The race for the White House is well underway, and climate change has been a top tier issue for Democrats running this year. We can at least in part thank Washington Governor Jay Inslee for that.\nInslee ain\u2019t running for president anymore, but he was the first candidate to ever run on a platform centered around climate change. He made it such a big part of his campaign, and that\u2019s a large reason why other candidates upped their game on it. And Inslee\u2019s advocacy also got mainstream media outlets that rarely pay mind to this massive issue (or cover it well for that matter) to actually devote substantial time to it by hosting presidential forums and including it as part of debates.\nSo shout out to Inslee. And shout out to candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who continue to propose bold policy to help solve this ecological crisis. It\u2019s about damn time people with power start to talk about humanity\u2019s largest threat.\nEver since Donald Trump entered the White House, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska has been under threat (all because a friend told him to open it to drilling). And every year, it\u2019s been spared. This winter, though, the Trump administration had its eyes set on surveying the refuge\u2019s 1.5 million coastal plain. That would\u2019ve been bad news for the polar bears, caribou, and people who live off the land.\nLuckily, the administration blew its chance to get that process underway for this year. That doesn\u2019t mean that the refuge\u2014one of the most pristine landscapes left in the U.S.\u2014is safe. But with any luck, 2020 will be Trump\u2019s last year in the White House. And with the most of the Democrats looking to replace him ready stop drilling on public lands, the refuge may finally be safe. And that\u2019d be the biggest win.\nIt\u2019s been nearly an entire decade since the House of Representative wasn\u2019t led by a bunch of dumbass Republicans. And during Republican rule, the House was known more for holding sham hearings on climate change than actually taking the crisis seriously. Now that Democrats run the House, the climate crisis is back in the chambers. This was the year Congress finally held a formal hearing on the crisis.\nAnd that\u2019s a big deal. Without experts coming in to educate representatives on the crisis, bills won\u2019t get written. Without any bills, the climate crisis will just continue to worsen.\nDemocrats\u2019 first hearing centered points around climate justice, youth, and solutions. A teen was even invited to speak before Congress (though members did ignore her). Subsequent hearings, including in front of the newly assembled Subcommittee on the Climate Crisis, haven\u2019t been exactly inspiring either. But the progressive wing of the House has put forth bold ideas like the Green New Deal, and the fact that representatives are even talking about climate change is a major step in the right direction.\nThis truly was the year of the teens (even if we crowned many young people as heroes in 2017). There\u2019s the rise of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who helped make \u201cclimate strike\u201d a word of the year and was named Time\u2019s Person of the Year. She joined forces with 15 other children to launch a freaking legal complaint against five of the world\u2019s major polluters for violating their rights. These 16 young people are challenging Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey to take action to reduce their greenhouse gases with binding commitments. If they succeed, they\u2019ll have made more headway than global leaders have in 25 years of climate talks.\nFossil fuel use must end if we want to save the planet. And that means renewable energy will play a major role in our fight against climate change. The U.K. is playing no games in that regard. The world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm came online in June. The energy it generates can power 287,000 homes, but that will increase to a million homes by next year. Yes, a million.\nAll this investment in the clean energy sector has allowed the U.K. to derive more electricity from renewables than coal and other fossil fuels this year, largely due to falling renewable energy prices. That hasn\u2019t happened since 1882. It shows even the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution is ready to ditch dirty energy. Bye, Felicia!\nAh, climate emergency\u2014another word of the year. It\u2019s a sign of the times that our language around climate change is shifting. And so are attitudes, as evidenced by the growing number of climate emergency declarations from local, state, and national government. They began to appear last year, but 2019 is the year they took off. \nScientists have sounded the alarm. More than 1,080 governments have declared climate emergencies, according to data monitored by Climate Mobilization.

Bushfires near the city set off indoor smoke alarms at the TV studio and interrupted the evening broadcast.\n\u201cThe smoke alarm went off about half an hour or so before our bulletin and kept ringing when we went to air at 7pm,\u201d ABC journalist Tom Maddocks told Gizmodo via email. \u201cIt was far too loud in the studio so outside was the best option. Our bulletin runs for half an hour (7-730).\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just in Canberra. Sydney experienced a similar thing last week when at least 80 indoor fire alarms caused offices in the central business district to evacuate\u2014something that people are slowly learning to live with as climate change creates new headaches in the land down under.\nAustralia just can\u2019t seem to catch a break. Bushfires have been\u00a0ravaging the country for more than\u2026\nThe beginning of tonight\u2019s ABC broadcast, which you can watch below, featured a report on the ways that smoke has forced people to cancel outdoor plans in Australia, just as summer has begun in the southern hemisphere. The report also looked at the surge in sales of inhalers and attempts to keep pets safe as the heat becomes so bad that you can literally make roasted pork in your car.\n\u201cTonight we\u2019re broadcasting from the front of the ABC building in Dickson, where smoke has prompted the fire alarms to go off like so many buildings across our capital. This appears to be becoming the new normal,\u201d journalist Dan Bourchier said to open the night\u2019s broadcast.\n\u201cWe woke up this morning with this thick smoke haze blanketing the city. Again, familiar landmarks obscured by the smoke,\u201d Bourchier continued. \u201cAuthorities say there are no fires burning here and the smoke is being blown in from those blazes around the territory.\u201d\nAustralia is already experiencing a dramatic bushfire season, with very little rain and record-breaking heat. And some of the country\u2019s largest cities, like Sydney and Canberra, have been choked with smoke for weeks, all from nearby fires that are blazing out of control.\nWhat is the Australian government doing to combat the smoke in its largest cities? So far, the federal government hasn\u2019t done much. In fact, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is reportedly vacationing in Hawaii as the country tries to grapple with smoke pollution that is harming the quality of life for millions. Strangely, the Prime Minister\u2019s office denies that he\u2019s in Hawaii, but won\u2019t say where he is at the moment. \nTwitter hashtags like #FireMorrison and #WheresScoMo, a reference to Morrison\u2019s nickname, have been trending this week in Australia as people vent their frustrations and no one is quite sure where the prime minister might be during this national climate emergency. \nMorrison isn\u2019t quite an extreme climate denier like President Donald Trump, but his party has embraced the use of coal-fired power plants and rejects the idea that Australia should do much of anything to address climate change.\nIf you want a vision of America\u2019s climate future, all you need to do is take a peek at what\u2019s happening in Australia right now. And it\u2019s not encouraging, to say the least. Climate change isn\u2019t some abstract futuristic dystopia. It\u2019s the present reality for people who are just trying to live their lives in an increasingly dangerous world.", "body_links": ["https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/12/sydney-smoke-is-triggering-indoor-alarms/", "https://youtu.be/173lOtTUcM4", "https://10daily.com.au/shows/10-news-first/perth/a191217ymshf/man-successfully-roasts-pork-inside-his-old-datsun-oven-20191217", "https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/notmypm-firemorrison-smoko-hawaii-051007224.html", "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/12/16/pm-scott-morrison-hawaii-holiday/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-election-energy/in-coal-we-trust-australias-voters-back-pm-morrisons-faith-in-fossil-fuel-idUSKCN1SP06F", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-16/australia-climate-carry-over-credits-slammed-cop25/11793818"]},

After overrunning its initial deadline Friday, the conference is continuing into the early hours of Sunday.\nSick of this back-and-forth shit among world leaders, climate activists dumped literal horse manure outside of the COP25 venue and staged mock hangings in protest Saturday, according to a Reuters report. Led by the grassroots group Extinction Rebellion, protestors lambasted the international conference\u2019s 25-year history of broken promises and futile efforts to stymie rising carbon emissions, which have continued to hit record highs almost every year.\nOn Wednesday, young climate activists rushed the main stage at the United Nations climate talks in\u2026\n\u201cJust like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic, this COP\u2019s fiddling of carbon accounting and negotiating of Article 6 is not commensurate to the planetary emergency we face,\u201d Extinction Rebellion said in a statement. \nArticle 6 refers to a critical portion of the Paris Agreement on climate change that will regulate a complex carbon market system supplementing each country\u2019s individual emissions-cutting efforts. It\u2019s a central element of the Paris Agreement, the world\u2019s pact to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and ideally keep the heat to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). But the idea of being able to trade carbon pollution has shown little value in actually bringing emissions down in places where markets exist. And its insertion in the Paris Agreement has been fraught and divided member states along financial lines. \nAnother major fight has been over loss and damage, a mechanism where rich countries that have grown their economies while using the atmosphere as a carbon waste dump would pay poor countries who have done little to cause climate change but are suffering the worst impacts. So far, wealthy nations have balked. And that divide has become more stark at the talks in Madrid where resurgent right-wing nationalist regimes have tried to weaken draft texts.\nThe U.S., Brazil, Australia, India, and China have been singled out in particular for allegedly stalling negotiations, the Guardian reported, after failing to produce suitably revised plans for checking global temperature rise this century. \n Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the summit \u201can utter failure\u201d on Twitter Saturday as talks continued going nowhere fast. While there have always been disputes among participating member nations, the rigmarole at this year\u2019s conference is entirely unprecedented, according to Alden Meyer with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He told the BBC:  \n\u201cI\u2019ve been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we\u2019ve seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action.\u201d \n During negotiations earlier this week, a separate protest saw young climate activists storm the summit\u2019s main stage to remind world leaders whose futures are at stake should these talks fall through. Without additional regulations on carbon emissions, scientists warn that current national commitments are insufficient to avoid some dangerously serious consequences.

Unfortunately, the meat industry is a growing source of carbon pollution, and continuing to let meat consumption grow could eat up a huge chunk of the world\u2019s carbon budget by 2030. So, well, we gotta chill with the steak dinners.\nScientists from around the world are calling on middle- and high-income countries to set a deadline for the meat industry\u2019s growth. In a letter published in the Lancet Planetary Health Journal Wednesday, researchers highlight the role the livestock industry must play in meeting the pledges set forth in the Paris Agreement, which world leaders are contemplating in Madrid right now. \n Like many other Americans, I love meat. But as a climate reporter, it\u2019s one of my biggest\u2026\nThe Paris Agreement saw governments agree to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) if possible. To do that, the world will need to draw down emissions rapidly this decade. That means shifting away from business as usual.\nAnd for the livestock sector will be a huge part of that. Emissions from raising animals is responsible for 14.5 percent of all greenhouse gas pollution globally. Meat consumption has risen globally with China fueling a large part of the more recent rise (as well as Brazil to a lesser extent). If the world continues on this path, emissions from livestock will eat up nearly half of the world\u2019s carbon budget by 2030. \nThat\u2019s why the letter is calling on government leaders in middle- and high-income countries such as the U.S. and China to establish a timeline for \u201cpeak livestock,\u201d the point after which production of certain livestock species could not increase. From there, countries need to reduce emissions from this sector by identifying the largest sources, the companies using the most land, or both. What might prove most challenging, however, is figuring out how to shift the food sector away from meat and toward  more climate-friendly foods. I\u2019m talking about beans, fruits, vegetables, and seeds. \nThis type of societal transformation won\u2019t be simple, but the authors argue it\u2019s necessary. It doesn\u2019t mean leaving behind burgers completely. This letter and what it\u2019s calling for isn\u2019t trying to shame consumers for their meal choices. It\u2019s about systemic change, author Helen Harwatt, an environmental social scientist at Harvard University\u2019s Animal Law and Policy Program, told Earther in an email. \n\u201cI think [individual actions] will help to shift the markets generally via signaling and is a positive action,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut to achieve deep transformation of agriculture, we need system-level change, and that requires policymakers to act.\u201d\nThe climate world has been giving this sector, in particular, more and more attention as experts begin to envision what a diet on a hotter planet could look like. Fast food joints like Dunkin Donuts and Burger King are even incorporating plant-based \u201cmeats\u201d into their menus, showing it\u2019s also a business decision as much as it is a climate one.\nThe reality is, though, that we\u2019ll need to do more than change what we buy at the grocery store or eat for breakfast. The ones with power need to transition the agriculture industry toward a more sustainable model that doesn\u2019t use up massive amounts of land, send pollution running off into waterways, and emit harmful greenhouse gases. \nOtherwise we risk \u201cpotentially catastrophic [consequences] depending on how far temperature rises and how ecosystems respond to that and feedback between each other,\u201d Harwatt said. In short, we\u2019ll be fucked if leaders don\u2019t step up to the task.", "body_links": ["https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30245-1/fulltext#%20", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/a-fight-over-a-false-solution-is-at-the-center-of-madri-1840311268", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/un-report-shows-the-world-needs-to-cut-emissions-78-per-1840046835", "http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/", "http://www.fao.org/3/y4252e/y4252e05b.htm", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2018.1528965", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/you-can-eat-a-burger-and-still-fight-for-the-planet-1833163300", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/for-30-days-im-going-to-eat-like-im-trying-to-save-the-1832239885#_ga=2.214031575.1917763895.1550973837-229968814.1545242016", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/i-am-absolutely-here-for-dunkins-fake-ass-sausage-sandw-1836709246", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/fast-food-companies-are-getting-into-fake-meat-and-the-1834428763", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/humans-have-transformed-70-percent-of-land-on-earth-we-1837045976", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/how-historic-flooding-in-the-midwest-could-fuel-the-gul-1833615535"]},

Now, they\u2019re rolling out their strategy to change who\u2019s in the House in the first place.\nSunrise announced four Congressional primary endorsements on Thursday. All the candidates they\u2019ve endorsed have\u00a0committed to not take donations over $200 from fossil fuel companies, lobbyists, or PACs. They\u2019ve also pledged to develop and support policy that falls under the Green New Deal framework, including reaching net-zero greenhouse gases by 2030, creating millions of well-paying jobs, and realizing \u201ceconomic prosperity for all.\u201d Though it\u2019s not a strict requirement for Sunrise\u2019s endorsement, all four candidates also committed to not take money from any corporate PACs.\n\u201cWe believe that these early March primaries are critical opportunity for us to really create some momentum around candidates who are fully championing the Green New Deal,\u201d Evan Weber, Sunrise\u2019s political director, told Earther. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the first time that voters have the opportunity to cast their ballots for those kinds of candidates since the Green New Deal since it launched into the national spotlight in November of 2018.\u201d\nTwo are in the Chicago Area. One is 27-year old community organizer Robert Emmons Jr, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Bobby Rush. Rush is number two on the House\u2019s Energy and Commerce Committee and has criticized Sunrise\u2019s efforts to create a House Committee focused on a Green New Deal. \nMarie Newman, who also hopes to represent Chicago, is trying to unseat Democrat Dan Lipinski for the second time. Lipinski refused to co-sponsor Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Congressional resolution on a Green New Deal, and instead backed a bipartisan carbon tax bill that investigative outlet Sludge found\u00a0mirrors a plan proposed by the Climate Leadership Council. That group\u2019s founding members include ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Since Newman announced her run earlier this year, Lipinski has seen a surge in fossil fuel donations.\nSunrise is also endorsing Morgan Harper, who was formerly a lawyer with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and is challenging Democratic Representative Joyce Beatty to represent the Columbus area of Ohio. Beatty has said she supports renewable energy, but that some aspects of the Green New Deal such as new energy standards for housing are \u201cnot really realistic.\u201d\nJust one of Sunrise\u2019s new endorsees is attempting to unseat a Republican: Civil rights lawyer and former public school teacher Mike Siegal is running against incumbent Michael McCaul, who has taken tens of thousand of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. The two also faced off in last year\u2019s midterms, when Siegal came within 5 percentage points of winning despite having far less funding.\nSunrise previously endorsed two other Congressional hopefuls: Jessica Cisneros, who\u2019s running against Democratic incumbent Henry Cuellar (who she used to intern for) in Texas, and Audrey Denney, who\u2019s running against Republican incumbent Doug LaMalfa in California for the second time. They\u2019ve also backed potential Senate candidate Charles Booker of Kentucky, Andrew Romanoff\u2019s primary run against former Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper (who has been derided as \u201cFrackenlooper\u201d because he supported natural gas expansion), and incumbent Senator Ed Markey in Massachusetts.\nWeber said that each of these candidates is localizing the Green New Deal with policies specific to their districts. \u201cPart of the strength of the Green New Deal is that it\u2019s so expansive, so candidates really have the opportunity to work on what it means for their district,\u201d said Weber. \u201cSo for instance, in Illinois, Marie Newman has talked a lot about her public transportation agenda where it\u2019s really needed... and in Texas, Mike Siegal is talking about the impact of fracking on rural communities, and on the need to create good union jobs away from the oil industry and on supporting sustainable agriculture.\n\u201cIn 2020 we\u2019re looking to create a political mandate for the Green New Deal. We\u2019re going to show that it\u2019s not just popular in the public, but it can help win elections, and that it\u2019s the future of the Democratic Party.\u201d", "body_links": ["https://earther.gizmodo.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-spent-part-of-her-congressiona-1830416425", "https://medium.com/sunrisemvmt/sunrise-movement-launches-first-wave-of-congressional-primary-endorsements-fortifying-green-new-535a1f21876", "https://www.sunrisemovement.org/pledge", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/aoc-just-dropped-her-green-new-deal-proposal-heres-what-1832427261", "https://earther.gizmodo.com/not-the-leadership-this-moment-calls-for-progressives-1831364598", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded", "https://readsludge.com/2019/06/20/leader-of-centrist-climate-caucus-has-millions-invested-in-oil-and-gas-companies/", "https://readsludge.com/2019/07/23/facing-a-green-new-deal-backer-lipinski-gets-a-boost-from-oil-and-gas-pacs/", "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/morgan-harper-campaign-ohio", "https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00026460", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/texas-10th-congressional-district/", "https://www.opensecrets.org/races/geography?cycle=2018&id=TX10&spec=N", "https://www.westword.com/news/can-hickenlooper-2020-outrun-frackenloopers-legacy-11258274"]}
